# dataBASED

Our website will host a collection of artwork layered on a geographical map to gain insight on prominent works for a given country or time period. We will allow users to explore a diverse range of artistic expression across the globe through our innovative digital platform. Users will also be able to discover the historical and cultural significance for pieces of art that hold influence.

Art history represents where humans have been and where weâ€™re going. For many, art history can require extensive memorization, where one must be able to identify significant art works, periods, artists, techniques and categories. The sheer volume of information can be overwhelming. We are solving the non-trivial problem of helping make art more digestible and accessible; our hope is to make learning about art immersive.
