21343,Johann Anton Alban Ramboux,1790,1866,"German painter and lithographer. He studied with a former Benedictine monk Abraham (Jean Henri Gilson) in Florenville, Luxembourg from 1803 to 1807. In 1807-12 he was in Paris as a pupil of Jacques-Louis David, whose portraiture influenced him decisively. In 1813 he returned to his native town Trier. In 1815 he was at the Academy in Munich where he was the student of the sculptors Franz and Konrad Eberhard. In early 1816 Ramboux went to Rome, where he worked until June 1822. There he joined the Nazarenes and became friend to Peter Cornelius, Carl Philipp Fohr, Joseph Anton Koch and Johann Friedrich Overbeck. In the summer of 1822 he returned to Trier settled there for ten years. In these years, he made many watercolours with views of the city and the Moselle. Sixteen of these watercolours formed the template for lithographs which he produced and published in 1825. In the spring of 1832 he went again to Italy, where he stayed until September 1842. In Italy, he produced landscapes and genre scenes, but his main activity was to copy frescoes and mosaics from the 13th-16th centuries. Returning to Germany he became curator of the Wallraf collection in Cologne. In 1854 he made a pilgrimage to Jerusalem where he created many watercolours for later lithographs. In 1858 he became the first honorary citizen of his native town. "

63976,Matteo de'Pasti,1415,1472,"Italian medallist, architect, painter and illuminator. He came from a good Veronese family (his father was a doctor, two of his brothers were in the church and three others were merchants). He is first documented in 1441, when he was working in Venice as painter to Piero di Cosimo de' Medici illustrating Petrarch's Trionfi (untraced). Subsequently (1444-46), he worked as an illuminator for the Este court, under the direction of Giorgio d'Alemagna. None of his works from this period is known. He married Elisa Baldigara of Rimini and moved there by 1449. Sigismondo Malatesta, the lord of Rimini, employed de' Pasti on several projects, including the rebuilding of the church of San Francesco by Leon Battista Alberti. De' Pasti's name appears as 'architect' inside the Tempio Malatestiana, as the building is known, but the extent of his contribution is unclear. By 1454 he was referred to as 'noble' and was entrusted with responsibility for all architectural and artistic work within the state. This brought him into contact with Piero della Francesca, Leon Battista Alberti, Agostino di Duccio and many other artists working at the court. He was strongly influenced by Pisanello, who had made medals for Sigismondo in the mid-1440s. Sigismondo sent de' Pasti, as requested, to Turkey to take the portrait of Sultan Mehmed, but he was arrested as a spy by the Venetian authorities and imprisoned briefly. He was last referred to in May 1467, and had died by the middle of 1468. "

35029,William Morris Hunt,1824,1879,"American painter whose work was influenced by French artists of the time, and his genre paintings are romantic and somewhat sentimental, as seen in The Bathers 1877. He was born in Brattleboro, Vermont, the brother of Richard Morris Hunt, a celebrated architect. He studied in Germany 1845-46 and Paris 1846-55 before settling in Boston in 1862. His first aspirations for art were in the direction of sculpture, and he entered the Royal Academy at Düsseldorf in 1846, with that purpose in view. But after a few months this taste gave place to a preference for painting, and he became a pupil of Couture at Paris, subsequently coming under the influence of Millet, whose broad method of tendering humanity and nature was henceforth suggested in the style of Hunt. In 1855 he returned to the United States and had a studio in Newport, but soon settled permanently in Boston, where he taught art with great success. Among his important works are portraits of Chief-Justice Shaw, painted for the Essex bar, Judge Horace Gray, Mrs. Charles Francis Adams, William M. Evarts. James Freeman Clarke, and Charles Sumner. His compositions, generally single figures broadly and forcibly rendered, include the Prodigal Son, Priscilla, The Drummer Boy (1861); Fortune Teller, Marguerite, and The Bathers, which is one of his best known works. Chief among his landscapes are Gloucester Harbor and Plowing, combining landscape and figure. Toward the close of his life Hunt executed two ambitious allegorical mural paintings for the state capitol at Albany, entitled The Flight of Night and The Discoverer. "

32646,Matteo Rosselli,1578,1650,"Italian painter. An influential artist of the early 17th century in Florence, he is described by the early sources as being of a gentle disposition and as a dedicated and dignified painter, although he lacked originality and power. His work is characterized by the simplicity, descriptive naturalism and refined colour of the Counter-Reformation art created by such Tuscan artists as Santi di Tito, Bernardino Poccetti, Lodovico Cigoli and Domenico Passignano, yet he was also responsive to Venetian and Emilian art. The son of Alfonso Rosselli and Elena Coppi, he received his early education in Gregorio Pagani's studio, which he attended from as early as 1587. His initial inclination was towards classical and balanced compositions, in which the influence of Andrea del Sarto, whose frescoes he copied in the Chiostro dello Scalzo, is clear. On 26 February 1599 he was admitted to the Accademia del Disegno and in 1605 went to be with Passignano in Rome for six months, greatly enriching his artistic experiences through this contact. He returned to Florence in the same year and, on Pagani's death (1605), completed his master's unfinished works with great success. Pagani's influence can be seen in the bright colours of Rosselli's Adoration of the Magi (1607; Montevarchi, Arezzo, S Andrea). To 1610 belong two monochrome paintings depicting Henry IV at Nantes and Henry IV at Gaudebec (Florence, Pitti, repository), executed for the funerary ceremonies that took place in S Lorenzo on the death of the French sovereign. Rosselli's interest in fluent, fresh and richly anecdotal narrative, indebted to Poccetti, is already evident in these works. In his Crucifixion (1613; Scarperia, Prepositurale), still within a Florentine tradition, there is a more varied chiaroscuro and a more expressive and softer handling, which suggests a response to Coreggio, whose art he probably knew through Pagani. His interest in anecdote found its full expression in the lunettes (1614-18) depicting scenes from the lives of the founders of the Servite Order in the Chiostro dei Morti of the church of the Annunziata, Florence, and is also demonstrated, in combination with the brilliant colour of his earlier paintings, inspired by Lodovico Cigoli, in his Last Supper (1614; Florence, Conservatorio di S Pier Martire). To 1615 belongs the painting of the Fortifications of San Miniato, the first of three scenes (the others were completed in 1627 and 1628) drawn from the life of Michelangelo whose nephew, Michelangelo Buonarroti the younger, commissioned them for the Casa Buonarroti, Florence. Here the rhetorical gestures are softened by the realism of the facial expressions and by the landscape, which is enriched by lively figures in the background. From 1619 Rosselli won the patronage of such important families as the Medici, the Corsini and the Dragomanni, and his activity increased. For the reception rooms of the villa at Poggio Imperiale he executed frescoes portraying the emperors Charles V, Frederick II and Maximilian I as well as biblical and historical heroines, datable to between 1619 and 1623. He took part in the frescoed decoration (1620) of the façade of the Palazzo dei dell'Antella in Piazza Santa Croce, Florence, and in 1621 won the commission for the Triumph of David (Florence, Pitti) and for the pair of paintings depicting Lot and his Daughters and Tobias and the Angel (1621; Florence, Galleria Corsini). The Triumph of David is a successful work, with skilled chiaroscuro and a disciplined yet intense atmosphere; the latter two works are characterized by more idealized figures, more classical compositions, and a greater delicacy of handling. These qualities distinguish this period of the artist's work. Further decorations (1622-3) were commissioned by Leopoldo de' Medici for the Casino di S Marco; these works, rich in echoes of Venetian art, depict the Rebuilding of the Port of Livorno by Frederick II and the Capture of Ippona (Florence, Corte d'Assise). Leopoldo also commissioned from Rosselli the allegorical paintings (1622) in the Sala della Stufa in Palazzo Pitti. "

34268,Carlo Dolci,1616,1686,"He was the leading painter in Florence in the mid-17th century, and an exponent of the restrained style of Late Baroque comparable with Sacchi's Roman works. Dolci was extremely precocious and one of his finest pictures is the portrait, painted when he was 16, of Fra Ainolfo dei Bardi (1632, Florence, Pitti). Nevertheless, he later became very neurotic and felt himself to be professionally inadequate. Most of his later works are small devotional pictures often painted on copper in an extremely finicky and detailed manner. When Giordano was in Florence in 1682 he said jokingly that his own virtuoso style had brought him a fortune of 150,000 scudi, but that by spending so much time on his works Dolci would starve; an idea that preyed on Dolci's mind. One of his best works is the Martyrdom of St Andrew of 1646 (Florence, Pitti), for which there is a sketch of 1643 in Birmingham. There are also two splendid portraits in Cambridge (Fitzwilliam Museum). Other works are in Glasgow, London (National Gallery, Victoria and Albert Museum, Wallace Collection. and Dulwich) and Oxford.

17676,Domenico Morelli,1826,1901,"Italian painter and teacher. Unique among his Italian colleagues in enjoying an international reputation in his lifetime, he was, with Filippo Palizzi, the leading exponent of the Neapolitan school of painting in the second half of the 19th century and a major figure in the artistic and cultural life of Italy. He studied at the Academy of Arts in Naples. His early works are Romantic and contain imagery drawn from the Middle Ages and Byron. In 1848 he won a fellowship to study in Rome. Morelli visited Florence in the 1850s where he received his first public recognition for The Iconoclasts. He participated in the Universal Exposition in Paris in 1855 and, later, in Florence was an active participant in the Macchiaioli discussions on Realism. By the mid-1860s Morelli was one of the best-known Italian painters of the times. In 1868, Morelli became a professor of painting at his old school, the Royal Academy of Fine Arts in Naples. From that period onward, his interest turned to religious, mystical and supernatural themes, drawn from Christian, Jewish and even Muslim sources. Perhaps best-known from this period is the Assumption on the ceiling of the Royal Palace in Naples. From 1899 until his death, he was president of the Royal Academy of Fine Arts in Naples. His realistic treatment of Romantic subjects revitalized academic painting, and his bold rendering of light and dark and his use of colour influenced both academic artists and more innovative painters such as the Macchiaioli. Morelli's paintings deal primarily with religious, historical, and literary subjects. They are marked by an intense, dramatic treatment of subject and, at the same time, by a realistic rendering of the details of everyday life. "

31314,Jean Goujon,1510,1570,"French sculptor. He ranks second only to Germain Pilon as the greatest French sculptor of the 16th century and he created a distinctive Mannerist style as sophisticated as the finest works of painting and decoration of the contemporary School of Fontainebleau. Nothing is known of his early life and he is first recorded in 1540 as the carver of the fine columns supporting the organ loft in the church of S. Maclou at Rouen. The pure classicism of these columns has caused some critics to assume that he had first-hand knowledge of Italian art. He had moved to Paris by 1544, when he was working on the screen of St. Germain-l'Auxerrois, in collaboration with the architect Pierre Lescot. Low-relief panels (now in the Louvre) from this screen show that Goujon had evolved a style of extreme grace and delicacy, owing something to the influence of Benvenuto Cellini. The style is seen at its most mature in his decorations (now in the Louvre) for the Fontaine des Innocents, Paris (1547-49). The six relief panels of nymphs from the fountain, with their exquisitely carved rippling draperies, are generally considered his masterpieces. Goujon's most extensive undertaking was on the sculptural decoration of the Louvre; he worked there from 1549 to 1562 in collaboration with Lescot, mainly on decorative panels forming part of the architectural scheme. Unfortunately all Goujon's work there has been heavily restored, including the famous caryatids (1550-51) in the Salle des Caryatides. Using caryatids on a monumental scale was a novelty, perhaps inspired by his reading of Vitruvius (he made illustrations for the first French edition of his treatise in 1547). There is no indication of any work executed after 1562 and it is possible that Goujon left France because of religious persecution and died in Bologna (the documentation is ambiguous). "

41503,Lodewijk Toeput,1540,1613,"Lodewijk Toeput (Lodovico Pozzoserrato, Pozzo da Treviso), Flemish painter and draughtsman, active in Italy. He was apparently a pupil of Marten de Vos and went to Italy probably after 1573. In Venice he presumably joined Tintoretto's workshop. Toeput may have witnessed the event he commemorated in his Fire in the Doge's Palace (1577; Treviso, Museo Civico Bailo). Either before or after this commission, he made six landscape frescoes (c. 1575 or 1577-79) for the abbey of Praglia, which reveal a strong adherence to Flemish conventions. Some years later he painted three frescoes in the church of S Giustina in Padua. He was in Florence in the late 1570s and visited Rome in 1581; by February 1582 he is documented in Treviso, near Venice, where he settled. He remained in close contact with Venetian masters, particularly through another Flemish artist active there, Pauwels Franck (1540-96), whose influence is evident in Toeput's representation of the Four Seasons (c. 1584; private collection), of which two tondi versions exist, which are attributed to Toeput (e.g. Providence, Rhode Island School of Design Museum of Art, and private collection). Around 1585 he painted a friezelike series: two canvases (in situ), each with two biblical scenes, for the chapel of the Rettori in the church of the Monte di Pieta in Treviso. These compositions were inspired by Netherlandish engravings and works by Tintoretto and Jacopo and Leandro Bassano. Probably dating from the same time is Susanna and the Elders (private collection). One of Toeput's favourite motifs was a formal Mannerist garden containing trellises and sculptures, which he included in Dives and Lazarus (Kassel, Schloss Wilhelmshöhe). It also appears in his versions of the Banquet in the Open Air (private collection) and in his Outdoor Concert. Only a few of Toeput's church paintings mentioned in early literature survive in Treviso, in the churches of S Leonardo, S Maria Maggiore and S Agostino; similarly the surviving frescoes are scarce and in a poor state of preservation. Around 1590 Toeput painted six landscapes representing The Months for the Villa Chiericati-Magna, Vicenza, and in 1593 he decorated the interior of the Scuola dei Battuti in nearby Conegliano with figures of sibyls and prophets and Old Testament scenes.

He was a precocious artist (his highly accomplished frescos in the Doria Palace, now the Prefettura, in Genoa were done in 1544, when he was only 17) and he became the dominating figure in 16th century Genoese painting, running a large and productive workshop. His style derives from Michelangelo in the massiveness of his figures and Correggio in the softness of his modelling, but the use of dry paint and the simplification of forms are his own. The latter is particularly noticeable in his drawings, which often utilize geometrical forms that give them a superficially Cubist look. Another curious instance of antecedence is apparent in his night scenes, which have been claimed as sources for Georges de La Tour, even though it is not clear by what route they could have become known to him. In 1583 Luca accepted an invitation from Philip II of Spain to work on decorations at the Escorial. He died there in 1585 and was succeeded by Federico Zuccaro and then Pellegrino Tibaldi. "

35838,Giovanni Battista Moroni,1520,1578,"Italian painter, son of an architect, Andrea Moroni. Moroni was one of the greatest, albeit the shyest, portrait painters of the sixteenth century. He trained under Moretto in Brescia and worked mainly in his home town of Albino and in nearby Bergamo. His style was based closely on that of his master, but whereas his religious and allegorical paintings are generally heavy-handed, his portraits are worthy successors to Moretto's. They are remarkable for their psychological penetration, dignified air, and exquisite silvery tonality. The National Gallery, London, has the best collection of his work, including the celebrated portrait known as The Taylor. After serving his apprenticeship with Moretto in Brescia, Giovan Battista Moroni spent nearly all his career in and around Bergamo, where he continued Lotto's tradition. The only deviance to this were two periods spent in Trento (1548 and 1551) when the Council of Trent was in session. On both occasions Moroni painted a number of works (including the Altarpiece of the Doctors of the Church for the church of S. Maria Maggiore). It was during his stays in Trento that he also made contact with the Madruzzo family and with Titian. From the 1550s onwards, in fact, Moroni was often commissioned as an alternative portraitist to Titian. A whole stream of provincial lords and ladies took it in turns to sit for him. The result is a series of portraits of people full of dignified humanity and concrete in every sense. Heroism is not in their vocabulary, but they are all well grounded in everyday life. His religious paintings are rarer, but we should at least mention The Last Supper in the parish church at Romano in Lombardy. "

37043,Joseph Mallord William Turner,1775,1851,"English painter, one of the greatest and most original of all landscape painters. His family called him Bill or William, but he is now invariably known by his initials. Precociously gifted, he became a student at the Royal Academy Schools in 1789 and first exhibited a watercolour at the Academy in 1790, when he was only 15. He studied at the Academy for four years, and during this time also had lessons from Thomas Malton (1748-1804), a topographical watercolourist who specialized in neat and detailed town views. From 1791 Turner began making regular sketching tours, producing many drawings of picturesque views and architectural subjects that he later sold to engravers or worked up into watercolours. At this time his work was more polished but less inventive than that of his friend Girtin (with whom he worked for Dr Monro). Initially he painted only in watercolour, but in 1796 he first exhibited an oil at the Academy, Fishermen at Sea (Tate Gallery, London), a work showing his admiration for 17th-century Dutch marine painting. Only three years later, in 1799, he was elected an Associate of the Royal Academy at the youngest permitted age (24), and in 1802 he became the youngest ever full Academician. His career flourished in terms of money as well as prestige, for he was hardworking, a good businessman, and frugal by nature (he lived rather squalidly, but he was not miserly or ungenerous, as is sometimes maintained). The Dutch influence in Turner's work soon gave way to that of Claude and Wilson, but already in the early 1800s it was recognized that he was introducing a new and revolutionary approach to landscape, his painting becoming increasingly Romantic in its dramatic subject-matter and sense of movement, as in the powerful Shipwreck (Tate Gallery, London, 1805). During these years, however, he continued exhibiting pictures in a more conventional manner and still worked for engravers (his most ambitious engraving project was his Liber Studiorum, conceived in emulation of Claude's Liber Veritatis and intended to show the range of his own work; between 1807 and 1819 he issued 71 of a projected 100 plates). Turner made his first journey to the Continent in 1802, during a temporary peace in the war with France, visiting Paris like so many other artists to see pictures looted by Napoleon, which were then on exhibition. From Paris he travelled on to Switzerland. The resumption of war made Continental travel impossible for more than a decade, and Turner did not go abroad again until 1817, when he visited Belgium. Holland, and the Rhine. He first visited Italy two years later, and from then until 1845 made fairly regular journeys abroad (including three more to Italy, the last in 1840). Unlike his contemporary Constable, who concentrated on painting the places he knew best, Turner was inspired to a great extent by what he saw on his travels (he lived in London all his life, but the city appears fairly infrequently in his paintings). The mountains and lakes of Switzerland and the haunting beauty of Venice, in particular, provided him with an enduring fond of subjects. On his journeys he was in the habit of making rapid pencil jottings, which he used later as reminders for imaginative compositions. He was inspired by history (especially ancient history) and literature as well as nature. Many of the paintings he exhibited at the Royal Academy were accompanied by verses printed in the catalogue, and from 1800 he added lines he had composed himself. From the 1830s Turner's painting became increasingly free, with detail subordinated to general effects of colour and light. His work was often attacked by critics, one of his most celebrated pictures - Snow Storm: Steam-Boat off a Harbour's Mouth (Tate Gallery, London, 1842) - being dismissed as 'soapsuds and whitewash'. However, he also had many admirers, including some who regarded him as the outstanding genius of the day. His most important patron was the third Earl of Egremont (1751-1837), who was unusual among collectors of the time in buying contemporary British art (sculpture as well as painting) on a large scale. Turner had a studio at Petworth, Egremont's country house in Sussex, and several of his paintings are still to be seen there (although their ownership was transferred to the Tate Gallery in 1984). Turner's other great champion was the young Ruskin, who discovered his work in the 1830s and wrote eloquently of him in the first volume of Modern Painters, published in 1843. By this time Turner's brushwork had become breathtakingly free and some of his compositions were almost abstract, the forms dissolved in a haze of light and colour: 'He seems to paint with tinted steam, so evanescent and so airy', wrote Constable. Turner's originality lay not only in such handling of colour and light - in which he anticipated  Impressionism - but also in his use of the power, beauty, and mystery of nature to express deep human concerns. For example, The Fighting Temeraire (National Gallery, London, 1839), showing a ship that had fought at Trafalgar being towed to the breaker's yard, is a poignant elegy for a passing era. Turner always led a fairly solitary existence and late in life he became more and more of a recluse, sometimes calling himself Mr Booth (assuming the name of his mistress Sophia Booth). After his death, Ruskin destroyed many erotic drawings that he found among his works, thinking that they tainted his hero's memory. In his will Turner left plans for disposing of his considerable fortune (he wanted to found an almshouse for 'poor and decayed male artists') and for the creation of a special gallery at the National Gallery to display certain of his paintings (he had a huge stock of his work, including not only pictures that had never been sold, but also favourite paintings that he had bought back at auction). Long-forgotten relatives contested the will (which was ambiguously worded) and won the money in 1856; at the same time the Court of Chancery awarded all the works remaining in his possession at his death to the National Gallery - about 300 oils and 19,000 drawings and watercolours. Most of these are now in Clore Gallery at the Tate Gallery, but a few of Turner's most famous oils remain in the National Gallery. "

35584,Andrea Mantegna,1431,1506,"Mantegna, Andrea (1431-1506), one of the foremost north Italian painters of the 15th century. A master of perspective and foreshortening, he made important contributions to the compositional techniques of Renaissance painting. Born (probably at Isola di Carturo, between Vicenza and Padua) in 1431, Mantegna became the apprentice and adopted son of the painter Francesco Squarcione of Padua. He developed a passionate interest in classical antiquity. The influence of both ancient Roman sculpture and the contemporary sculptor Donatello are clearly evident in Mantegna's rendering of the human figure. His human forms were distinguished for their solidity, expressiveness, and anatomical correctness. Mantegna's principal works in Padua were religious. His first great success was a series of frescoes on the lives of St. James and St. Christopher in the Ovetari Chapel of the Church of the Eremitani (1456; badly damaged in World War II). In 1459 Mantegna went to Mantua to become court painter to the ruling Gonzaga family and accordingly turned from religious to secular and allegorical subjects. His masterpiece was a series of frescoes (1465-74) for the Camera degli Sposi (“bridal chamber”) of the Palazzo Ducale. In these works, he carried the art of illusionistic perspective to new limits. His figures depicting the court were not simply applied to the wall like flat portraits but appeared to be taking part in realistic scenes, as if the walls had disappeared. The illusion is carried over onto the ceiling, which appears to be open to the sky, with servants, a peacock, and cherubs leaning over a railing. This was the prototype of illusionistic ceiling painting and was to become an important element of baroque and rococo art. Mantegna's later works varied in quality. His largest undertaking, a fresco series on the Triumphs of Caesar (1489, Hampton Court Palace, England), displays a rather dry classicism, but Parnassus (1497, Louvre, Paris), an allegorical painting commissioned by Isabelle d'Este, is his freshest, most animated work. His work never ceased to be innovative. In Madonna of Victory (1495, Louvre), he introduced a new compositional arrangement, based on diagonals, which was later to be exploited by Correggio, while his Dead Christ (Pinacoteca di Brera, Milan) was a tour de force of foreshortening that pointed ahead to the style of 16th-century Mannerism. One of the key artistic figures of the second half of the 15th century, Mantegna was the dominant influence on north Italian painting for 50 years. It was also through him that German artists, notably Albrecht Dürer, were made aware of the artistic discoveries of the Italian Renaissance. He died in Mantua on September 13, 1506. "

36351,Pierre-Auguste Renoir,1841,1919,"French Impressionist painter and sculptor. He was born in Limoges in 1841 as the child of a working class family. In 1845 his family moved to Paris where he went to work at the age of 13 as a decorator of factory-made porcelain, copying the works of Boucher. From 1862 to 1864 he attended the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris and studied under Charles Gleyre. He met Frédéric Bazille, Claude Monet and Alfred Sisley. He exhibited at the Salon in 1864. His early work reflected many influences including those of Courbet, Manet, Corot, Ingres and Delacroix. Under the influence of Gustave Courbet and painters of the School of Barbizon he turned to plein air painting. He began to earn his living with portraiture in the 1870s; an important work of this period was Madame Charpentier and her Children (Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York). Together with Claude Monet he develops the new painting style of Impressionism around 1870, he is regarded as one of its main representatives. He partakes in three group exhibitions of the Impressionists, for financial reasons he then again shows works at the conventional salons. However, his situation improves as the art dealer Durand-Ruel is his reliable customer. Renoir developed the ability to paint joyous, shimmering colour and flickering light in outdoor scenes such as The Swing and the festive Moulin de la Galette (both: 1876; Musée d'Orsay, Paris). In 1881-82 Pierre-Auguste Renoir goes on three longer journeys to Algeria and Italy. Returning to Paris, a successful exhibition in 1883 established him financially. His painting style slightly leaves the grounds of Impressionism as of the early 1880s, he begins to emphasize contours more and to model the physical features more plastically. His ecstatic sensuality, particularly in his opulent, generalized images of women, and his admiration of the Italian masters removed him from the primary Impressionist concern: to imitate the effects of natural light. After a brief period, often termed ""harsh"" or ""tight,"" in which his forms were closely defined in outline (e.g., the Large Bathers, 1884-87; Museum of Art, Philadelphia), his style of the 1890s changed, diffusing both light and outline, and with dazzling, opalescent colours describing voluptuous nudes, radiant children, and lush summer landscapes. In 1890, he married Aline Victorine Charigot, who, along with a number of the artist's friends, had already served as a model for Luncheon of the Boating Party (1881), and with whom he already had a child, Pierre, in 1885. After his marriage, Renoir painted many scenes of his wife and daily family life, including their children and their nurse, Aline's cousin Gabrielle Renard. The Renoirs had three sons, one of whom, Jean, became a filmmaker of note and another, Pierre, became a stage and film actor. In 1898 Renoir begins to suffer from rheumatoid arthritis, which makes it hard for him to do artistic work. He spends more and more time in the dry climate of Southern France, as of 1905 he makes Cagnes his permanent place of residence. A first retrospective is shown at the Paris fall salon in 1904. Despite illness and personal tragedy he began to produce major works of sculpture together with Maillol's student Richard Guino, who worked the clay, a co-operation that had been arranged by Ambroise Vollard. Renoir also used a moving canvas, or picture roll, to facilitate painting large works with his limited joint mobility. He died in the village of Cagnes-sur-Mer, Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur, on December 3, 1919. Pierre-Auguste Renoir was one of the founders and major figures of the Impressionist movement. He has become identified with its world of Parisian leisure (gardens, cafés, dances, boating scenes) which he infused with a luminous sensuality derived from his apprenticeship as a painter on porcelain of 18th-century Rococo scenes. His later work is devoted primarily to the representation of the female nude, with which he is most associated. Among writers, support came from Zola, Huysmans, Verhaeren, and above all Mallarmé, one of his closest friends, whose portrait he painted in 1892. "
56950,Martinus Rørbye,1803,1848,"Danish painter. His father was a civil servant in Norway, but the family had to leave the country after Norway's separation from Denmark in 1814. He began his studies at the Kunstakademi in Copenhagen in 1820. A student there for over ten years, he failed to win the major gold medal in spite of repeated attempts. His teacher was Christian August Lorentzen (1746-1828), but Christoffer Wilhelm Eckersberg also gave him private painting lessons. Even as a student Rorbye enjoyed some success, selling genre scenes to the royal family and portraits set in interiors to the middle classes of Copenhagen.  He exhibited at Charlottenborg most years between 1824 and 1848, and in 1849 his widow exhibited 12 of his paintings, mostly of Italian subjects. In 1830 and 1832 Rørbye travelled to Norway. He is known as an inveterate traveller. His first grand tour, which he took in 1834-37, took him Paris, Rome, Sicily, Greece and Turkey. In Paris he studied French contemporary art. He greatly admired Horace Vernet, in particular his exotic, oriental subjects. He also admired Théodore Géricault's Raft of the Medusa but, strangely, disliked the work of Eugène Delacroix. After Paris, Rørbye travelled to Rome, to Sicily and then, with the architect Gotlieb Bindesbøll, to Athens and Constantinople. Later in life, he undertook many more journeys, travelling to Italy in 1839-41 and to Sweden in 1844. That same year he was appointed Professor at the school of modelling at the Copenhagen Academy. Following Eckersberg's example, Rørbye was essentially a painter of genre pieces and architecture. His pictures were factual but displayed a uniquely sympathetic view of the people he painted. He also painted a few portraits and landscapes, the latter often inspired by Dahl and, to a certain extent, by Caspar David Friedrich. "

41796,John Francis Rigaud,1742,1810,"French painter, active in England. He studied in Turin, Florence and Bologna, and lived in Rome for two years from 1768. In 1771 he settled in London, becoming in the following year an Associate of the Royal Academy, and a full Academician in 1784. He received a steady stream of commissions for historical subjects, as well as decorative compositions and portraits. In 1775 he exhibited the Entry of the Black Prince into London with his Royal Prisoner (untraced); its subject from national history was an original choice for the time. From 1778 he painted for Boydell's Shakespeare Gallery such small pictures as Scene from 'Romeo and Juliet' (untraced). He also contributed to Macklin's Poets' Gallery. In 1794 he won what was probably his most important commission, the decoration of the four pendentives of the Common Council Chamber in the Guildhall, London, depicting Providence, Innocence, Wisdom and Happiness; of these only the preparatory oil sketches survive (London, Guildhall Art Gallery). Rigaud's most important patron was Heneage Finch, 4th Earl of Aylesford, who employed him to decorate the Pompeian Gallery at Packington Hall, Warwicks, in 1787 and the New Church in 1787 and 1792. Rigaud was one of the major painters of large-scale decorative schemes for fashionable interiors of the late 18th century. His early designs were Neo-classical in feeling, but his later work tended more towards the Baroque. His narrative pictures range from history subjects in the Grand Manner, which he painted principally for the theme galleries, to popular sentimental subjects intended for the print market. As a portrait artist, he could be frank and expressive when not seeking heroic effects; his best portraits are of fellow artists such as that of Joseph Nollekens (1772; Yale Center of British Art, New Haven) and a half-length group of his fellow Academicians, Sir William Chambers, Joseph Wilton and Sir Joshua Reynolds (1782; National Portrait Gallery, London).

One of the outstanding marine painters of his period, he moved from stormy subjects in the manner of Porcellis to serene and majestic images that influenced van de Cappelle and Willem van de Velde the Younger. De Vlieger also painted a few landscapes and genre pictures. Although de Vlieger's reputation rests chiefly on his marine paintings, he was also a notable draughtsman and etcher. "

52913,Filippo Falciatore,1718,1768,"Italian painter, active in Naples. He was a pupil of Lorenzo Vaccaro, and then of his son, Domenico Antonio Vaccaro (1678-1745), an artist whose influence was to pervade all his early work, inspiring small pictures bathed in clear, silvery light and azure tonalities that gradually shaped his 'neo-Mannerist' Rococo style. His early works are mostly scenes from the Old and New Testament, now dispersed among public and private collections both in Italy and abroad. In these works, while following the footsteps of the master, he updated the schemes with a new sensitivity. Of his activity as fresco-painter little remains, the first point of reference being 1741, when he frescoed the vault and walls of the sacristy of the church of Santa Maria del Carmine Maggiore in Naples. His rocaille sensibility reached the height of preciosity in the five panels with gold backgrounds and the two tondi representing Cain and Abel and Joseph and Potiphar's Wife (Naples, Museo Duca di Martina).

33850,Domenico Campagnola,1500,1564,"Italian painter and engraver of German origin. He was the son of a German artisan, but he probably learned from his adopted father, Giulio Campagnola, who instructed him in painting, drawing, engraving, and woodcutting. After his father's death around 1516, Campagnola was Venice's foremost printmaker. He innovated by cutting woodblocks himself rather than employing a professional woodcutter. His earliest prints and drawings show the influence of Albrecht Dürer. Campagnola's lush, flowing style and religious subject matter may also indicate access to Titian's workshop. By around 1520 Campagnola moved to Padua, where he became its busiest and most praised painter.  His best-known works are three frescoes in the Scuola del Carmine, Padua; Four Prophets (Academy, Venice); and Holy Family (Pitti Palace, Florence). His frescoes and easel paintings for churches and palaces betray his Venetian origins with their asymmetrical compositions and rich treatment of fabrics. Nevertheless, he remained most celebrated for his woodcuts and landscape drawings, which he sold as finished compositions. He drew raised foregrounds set against poetic vistas of paths, castles, bridges, and ruins, with jagged peaks of distant mountains. "

40492,Cigoli,1559,1613,"Cigoli (Lodovico Cardi), Florentine painter, architect, and poet. He was the outstanding Florentine painter of his generation and his work represents the complex stylistic cross-currents in the period of transition from Mannerism to Baroque. A key figure in the development of Baroque in Florence, Cigoli also played an important role in seventeenth-century Rome. After studying with the Florentine painters Alessandro Allori and Santi di Tito and the architect Bernardo Buontalenti, Cigoli received numerous Medici commissions, including designs for the pageant held on the occasion of Grand Duke Ferdinand I's marriage to Maria Christina of Lorraine in 1589. Cigoli's paintings of the 1590s, such as Heraclius Carrying the Cross (1594; San Marco, Florence) and The Martyrdom of St Stephen (1597; Galleria Palatina, Florence) reveal a new naturalism and clarity of composition, heralding in Florence a reform of the prevalent Mannerist style similar to that undertaken by the Carracci in Bologna. In 1604 Cigoli was summoned to Rome to paint St Peter Healing the Cripple for St Peter's (1604-06; fragments in crypt), a masterpiece on slate praised by Andrea Sacchi as the third greatest painting in Rome, after Raphael's Transfiguration and Domenichino's Last Communion of St Jerome. During the last decade of his life Cigoli frequently participated in important decorative enterprises in Rome. These included The Virgin of the Immaculate Conception in the dome of the Cappella Paolina in Santa Maria Maggiore (1610-13), painted for Pope Paul V, and a fresco cycle, depicting Psyche and Cupid, in the casino of Cardinal Scipione Borghese's palace on the Quirinal hill (1611-13; now in the Museo di Roma, Palazzo Braschi, Rome). In 1613, only a month before his death, Cigoli was made a knight of the Order of Malta. "

Initially, he studied law, but from 1886 he also attended the Académie Julian in Paris and subsequently the Écoée des Beaux-Arts. In 1889, he and his friends Maurice Denis, Paul Sérusier, Ker-Xavier Roussel, and Edouard Vuillard joined Paul Gauguin's Nabis group of artists, whose works are generally grouped under Symbolism. After his first great success as an artist (a poster for France-Champagne in 1890), Bonnard gave up the law. From 1910, he lived alternately in various cities (mainly Paris) and rural regions of France (Dauphiné, Normandy), as the subject matter of his pictures shows. In his painting, which comprises portraits, landscapes and still-lifes, Bonnard went back to Impressionism, which he extended by constructing his pictures in a completely new way and adopting a different palette. As a member of the Nabis group, Bonnard designed sets, costumes, and program vignettes for sundry French theatres and did illustrations for several periodicals, including La Revue Blanche. His lithographical works strongly influenced modern book graphics. "

51057,Gregorio Guglielmi,1714,1773,"Italian painter, active also in Germany and Central Europe. He trained either with Francesco Trevisani or with Sebastiano Conca. He was a protégé of Cardinal Alessandro Albani, and his early activity was centred in Rome, where he executed three canvases for St Catherine, Prague (one, St Augustine, in situ; two untraced), and the main altarpiece for S Apollonia, Rome (untraced). His Canonization of St Camillo de Lellis (Pinacoteca Vaticana, Rome) dates from 1746. His frescoes included those in the hospital of the Santo Spirito in Sassia (1742; destroyed); History Commands Time to Reveal the Truth (1746; Palazzo Corsini, Rome), commissioned by Cardinal Neri Corsini to decorate the history section of the Biblioteca Corsiniana in the Palazzo Corsini, Rome; the vault fresco, St Giovanni de Matha in Glory (1744-8), in Santa Trinità degli Spagnoli, Rome, and frescoes in the refectory of San Agostino, Rome, 1750-51; in situ). In these first documented works the use of warm, luminous colours and strongly modelled figures within a naturalistic composition demonstrates the artist's desire to unite the late Baroque of Conca with the developing classicism of Pierre Subleyras and Marco Benefial. In 1753 he was in Dresden, the following year in Vienna, where he painted the Allegory of the Four Faculties at the University (1755). After returning to Rome and stay in Turin, he worked again in Vienna (1760-1762), painting one of his major works, the frescoed ceiling of the small and the great gallery of Schönbrunn Palace. This illustrates the Austrian Provinces bringing their tribute to the Empire, Military Life and Benefits of Peace. Three sketches, light and colourful, for this set, is in the Louvre. The artist then returned to Rome, then left for Berlin (1763-64), where he decorated the university. He then worked in Turin (1765-1766), the royal palace, where he painted the Four Parts of the World, and the Palazzo del Duca di Genova (Palazzo Chiablese), then in Bergamo (2 paintings in the Colleoni Chapel). Called again in Germany , he lived in Augsburg (1766-1767), painting the ceiling of the hall of the Schaezler palace (now museum). He was commissioned by Stanislas Augustus, King of Poland to paint the Four Parts of the World (National Museum, Warsaw) and three sketches for the Apollo Gallery at the Palace Ujazdow, now in the Museum of Nancy. But instead of traveling to Poland, he entered the service of Catherine the Great (1769) and spent, with the exception of a short trip to Paris, the last years of his life in St. Petersburg. In his best works he demonstrated an exceptional brilliance as a decorator. "

56287,Eugène-Emmanuel Viollet-le-Duc,1814,1879,"French architectural historian/restorer; major theorist of the Gothic in 19th-century France; responsible for the ""over-restoration"" of many Gothic churches in France. He attended Fontenay, a school known for its anti-clerical republicanism. He participated in the 1830 revolution. Intent on an architectural career and politically liberal, Viollet-le-Duc decided against study at the conservative École des Beaux-Arts in favour of direct experience in the architect's office of Jean-Jacques-Marie Huvé (1783-1852), and Achille-François-René Leclère (1785-1853). Between 1831 and 1836 he visited the regions of Provence, Normandy, the châteaux of the Loire, as well as the Pyrenees and Languedoc. He married his wife, Elisabeth, in 1834 and secured a professorship of Composition and Ornament at a small independent school, the École de Dessin in Paris. In 1836 he traveled to Italy where he toured Rome, Sicily, Naples and Venice. He returned to Paris in 1837 and studying at the École. Viollet-le-Duc was appointed auditor to the Conseil des Bâtiments Civils in 1838, under his former teacher, Leclère. The Council controlled all buildings belonging to the State, both their construction and renovation. In 1840 Mérimée, as Inspecteur Général des Monuments Historiques, the commission responsible for assigning restoration projects, nominated Viollet-le-Duc for the restoration of the church of the Madeleine, Vézelay. Viollet-le-Duc replaced the later 13th-century pointed vaults with 12th-century semicircular groin vaults in order to give a sense of unity to the nave, but changing the character of the building. He continued to work on other restorations of churches, many of which had been damaged in the French Revolution and needed sculptural replacement to return them to their didactic ambiance. In Sainte-Chapelle and in 1844 Notre-Dame de Paris, a commission with his colleague, Jean-Baptiste Lassus, Viollet-le-Duc substituted new sculpture for the old, often moving the old to museums. Notre-Dame marked the first of Viollet-le-Duc extremist interventions in churches, altering building to fit his romantic vision the middle ages. Notre-Dame's famous gargoyles (grotesques), for example, are wholly his inventions. Even in his careful reconstructions, such as recutting sculptural molding (Rheims), 19th-century qualities of these works are apparent. The ""restoration"" of these buildings solidified Viollet-le-Duc's stature. He began to publish his theories of the Gothic in Annales archéologiques in 1845. In 1846 he worked on Saint-Denis abbey, Avignon between 1860-68, the cathedrals of Amiens (1849-1875), and Rheims (1861-1873) the churches at Poissy (1852-1865) and Sens. In 1854 he published his influential Dictionnaire raisonné de l'architecture. A second important work appeared four years later. His Entretiens sur l'architecture and Dictionnaire du mobilier of 1858 contained discussion on goldsmiths' work, musical instruments, jewellery and armor in addition to furniture. His own sketches accompanied the text. Although generally hailed in his own time for these restorations, Viollet-le-Duc had his detractors, including the sculptor Auguste Rodin. Viollet-le-Duc assisted on many commissions of the July Monarchy government (1830-1848), and the 1852 imperial court of Napoleon III, introduced by Mérimée. He maintained a personal architectural practice designing houses, churches and chateaux. Student revolts to his teaching of art history and esthetics at the École des Beaux-Arts resulted in his replacement by Hippolyte Taine in 1864. After his death, his likeness was placed as one of the twelve apostles on the bronze roof sculptures at Notre-Dame. "

8045,Barent Fabritius,1624,1673,"Dutch painter and draughtsman, brother of Carel Fabritius. Like Carel, he was first taught painting by his father, also learnt carpentry and practised as an artisan in Midden-Beemster in 1641. He is documented in Amsterdam in 1643 and 1647, though it is not known if, like his brother, he was also a pupil of Rembrandt. Nevertheless, his style is similar to that of the Rembrandt school. He must have been trained in the second half of the 1640s. His work is reminiscent of the style of his brother, who clearly influenced and may also have instructed him. In 1652 Barent lived in Amsterdam and married Catharina Mussers in Midden-Beemster. In the following years he is documented alternately in Midden-Beemster and Amsterdam. He painted a group portrait of the town master builder, Willem Leenderstsz. van der Helm and his Family (1656; Amsterdam, Rijksmuseum), in Leiden, and in 1660-61 he received further commissions for the Lutheran church in Leiden. From 1669 Barent lived with his family in Amsterdam, where he died at the age of 49. He was buried in the churchyard in Leiden that was usually reserved for the poorer inhabitants of Amsterdam. He left behind a wife, who lived until 1701, and six children. "

34593,Thomas Gainsborough,1727,1788,"English portrait and landscape painter, the most versatile English painter of the 18th century. Some of his early portraits show the sitters grouped in a landscape (Mr. and Mrs. Andrews, c. 1750). As he became famous and his sitters fashionable, he adopted a more formal manner that owed something to Anthony Van Dyck (The Blue Boy, c. 1770). His landscapes are of idyllic scenes. During his last years he also painted seascapes and idealized full-size pictures of rustics and country children. Early life and Suffolk period Gainsborough was the youngest son of John Gainsborough, a maker of woolen goods. When he was 13, he persuaded his father to send him to London to study on the strength of his promise at landscape. He worked as an assistant to Hubert Gravelot, a French painter and engraver and an important figure in London art circles at the time. From him Gainsborough learned something of the French Rococo idiom, which had a considerable influence on the development of his style. In 1746 in London he married Margaret Burr, the illegitimate daughter of the Duke of Beaufort. Soon afterward he returned to Suffolk and settled in Ipswich in 1752; his daughters Mary and Margaret were born in 1748 and 1752, respectively. In Ipswich Gainsborough met his first biographer, Philip Thicknesse. He early acquired some reputation as a portrait and landscape painter and made an adequate living. Gainsborough declared that his first love was landscape and began to learn the language of this art from the Dutch 17th-century landscapists, who by 1740 were becoming popular with English collectors; his first landscapes were influenced by Jan Wynants. The earliest dated picture with a landscape background is a study of a bull terrier--Bumper--A Bull Terrier (1745; Sir Edward Bacon Collection, Raveningham, Norfolk), in which many of the details are taken straight from Wynants. But by 1748, when he painted Cornard Wood, Jacob van Ruisdael had become the predominant influence; although it is full of naturalistic detail, Gainsborough probably never painted directly from nature. The Charterhouse, one of his few topographical views, dates from the same year as Cornard Wood and in the subtle effect of light on various surfaces proclaims Dutch influence. In the background to Mr. and Mrs. Andrews, he anticipates the realism of the great English landscapist of the next century, John Constable, but for the most part fancy held sway. In many of the early landscapes the influence of Rococo design learned from Gravelot is evident, together with a feeling for the French pastoral tradition. The Woodcutter Courting a Milkmaid is an Anglicized version of a French theme, which recalls compositions by Jean-Honoré Fragonard. Although Gainsborough preferred landscape, he knew he must paint portraits for economic reasons. The small heads painted in Suffolk, although sometimes rather stiff, are penetrating character studies delicately and freely pencilled, particularly the jaunty self-portrait in a cocked hat at Houghton. Gainsborough painted few full-length portraits in Suffolk. Mr. William Woollaston, although an ambitious composition, is intimate and informal. The Painter's Daughters Chasing a Butterfly, composed in the last years at Ipswich, is, in its easy naturalism and sympathetic understanding, one of the best English portraits of children. As well as straight portraits, he painted in Suffolk a number of delightful spontaneous groups of small figures in landscapes closely related to conversation pieces. Mr. and Mrs. Andrews, which has been described as the most English of English pictures, is set in a typical Suffolk landscape. Lady and Gentleman in Landscape is more Frenchified, with its vivacious Rococo rhythms, but Heneage Lloyd and His Sister is more stylized, the charming little figures being posed against a conventional background of steps and decorative urns. Bath period To obtain a wider public, Gainsborough moved in 1759 to Bath, where his studio was soon thronged with fashionable sitters. He moved in musical and theatrical circles, and among his friends were members of the Linley family, whose portraits he painted. At Bath he also met the actor David Garrick, for whom he had a profound admiration and whom he painted on many occasions. His passion for music and the stage continued throughout his life. In the west country he visited many of the great houses and at Wilton fell under the spell of Anthony Van Dyck, the predominating influence in his later work. In spite of the demand for portraits, he continued to paint landscapes. In 1761 he sent a portrait of Earl Nugent to the Society of Artists, and in the following year the first notice of his work appeared in the London press. Throughout the 1760s he exhibited regularly in London and in 1768 was elected a foundation member of the Royal Academy. Characteristically he never took much part in the deliberations. After he moved to Bath, Gainsborough had less time for landscape and worked a good deal from memory, often drawing by candlelight from little model landscapes set up in his studio. About 1760 Peter Paul Rubens supplanted the Dutch painters as Gainsborough's chief love. This is particularly noticeable in Peasants Returning from Market, with its rich colour and beautiful creamy pastel shades. The influence of Rubens is also apparent in The Harvest Wagon in the fluency of the drawing and the scale of the great beech trees so different from the stubby oaks of Suffolk. The idyllic scene is a perfect blend of the real and the ideal. The group in the cart is based on Rubens' Descent from the Cross (1611-14) in Antwerp cathedral, which Gainsborough copied. In Bath, Gainsborough had to satisfy a more sophisticated clientele and adopted a more formal and elegant portrait style based largely on a study of Van Dyck at Wilton, where he made a free copy of Van Dyck's painting of the Pembroke family. By 1769, when he painted Isabella Countess of Sefton, it is easy to see the refining influence of Van Dyck in the dignified simplicity of the design and the subtle muted colouring. One of Gainsborough's most famous pictures, The Blue Boy, was probably painted in 1770. In painting this subject in Van Dyck dress, he was following an 18th-century fashion in painting, as well as doing homage to his hero. The influence of Van Dyck is most clearly seen in the more official portraits. John, 4th Duke of Argyll in his splendid robes is composed in the grand manner, and Augustus John, Third Earl of Bristol rivals Reynolds' portraits of the kind. Gainsborough preferred to paint his friends rather than public figures, and a group of portraits of the 1760s - Uvedale Price, Sir William St. Quinton, and Thomas Coward, all oldish men of strong character - illustrate Gainsborough's sense of humour and his individual approach to sympathetic sitters. London period In 1774 he moved to London and settled in part of Schomberg House in Pall Mall. Fairly soon he began to be noticed by the royal family and partly because of his informality and Tory politics was preferred by George III above the official court painter, Sir Joshua Reynolds. In 1781 he was commissioned to paint the King and Queen. Gainsborough continued his landscape work. The Watering Place was described by Horace Walpole, the English man of letters, as in the style of Rubens, but it also has much of the classic calm of Claude Lorrain, whose etchings Gainsborough owned. In 1783 he made an expedition to the Lake District to see for himself the wild scenery extolled by the devotees of the picturesque. On his return he painted a number of mountain scenes that have analogies with the work of Gaspard Dughet, whose works were widely distributed in English country houses. Some sea pieces dating from the 1780s show a new kind of realism, harking back to the Dutch seascape tradition. During his last years Gainsborough was haunted by his nostalgia for Arcadia in the English countryside and painted a series of pictures of peasant life more ideal than real, for example, The Cottage Door. But one of the latest landscapes, The Market Cart, is less idealized and more true to nature and looks forward to Constable in its treatment of the light breaking through the massive foliage. Gainsborough was the only important English portrait painter to devote much time to landscape drawing. He composed a great many drawings in a variety of mediums including chalk, pen and wash, and watercolour, some of them varnished. He was always eager to find new papers and new techniques. He produced a magic lantern to give striking lighting effects; the box is still in the Victoria and Albert Museum, together with some of the slides. In addition Gainsborough made a series of soft-ground etchings and aquatints. He never sold his drawings and, although many of them are closely related to pictures, they are not studies in the ordinary sense but works of art in their own right. Gainsborough was not methodical in keeping sitter books, and comparatively few of the portraits in the early years in London are dated. In 1777 he exhibited at the Royal Academy the well-known Mrs. Graham, C.F. Abel, William Henry, Duke of Gloucester, and Maria, Duchess of Gloucester, all deliberately glamorous and painted in richly heightened colour. Queen Charlotte is more restrained; the painting of the flounced white dress decorated with ribbons and laces makes her look every inch a queen. It is significant that Gainsborough, unlike most of his contemporaries, did not generally use drapery painters. In 1784 he quarrelled with the Academy because they insisted on hanging the Three Eldest Princesses at the normal height from the floor, which Gainsborough maintained was too high to appreciate his lightness of touch and delicate pencilling. In protest he withdrew the pictures he had intended for the exhibition and never showed again at the Academy. In some of Gainsborough's later portraits of women, he dispensed with precise finish, and, without sacrificing the likeness, he concentrated on the general effect. Mrs. Sheridan melts into the landscape, while Lady Bate Dudley, a symphony in blue and green, is an insubstantial form, almost an abstract. Mrs. Siddons, on the other hand, shows that Gainsborough could still paint a splendid objective study. Few of the later male portraits are of a pronounced character, but exceptions are two particularly good pictures of musicians, Johann Christian Fischer and the unfinished Lord Abingdon (private collection). A new venture in 1783 was The Mall in St. James' Park, a park scene described by Horace Walpole as all a flutter like a lady's fan. The Morning Walk, with romanticized figures strolling in a landscape, is painted in the same spirit. The fancy pictures painted in the 1780s gave Gainsborough particular pleasure. They are full-sized, idealized portraits of country children and peasants painted from models - for example, The Cottage Girl with a Bowl of Milk. The idea appeared in immature form in the little rustic Suffolk figures, and he may have been fired to exploit it further by seeing the 17th-century Spanish painter Bartolomé Murillo's St. John, which he copied. He died in 1788 and was buried in Kew churchyard. Assessment Of all the 18th-century English painters, Thomas Gainsborough was the most inventive and original, always prepared to experiment with new ideas and techniques, and yet he complained of his contemporary Sir Joshua Reynolds, Damn him, how various he is. Gainsborough alone among the great portrait painters of the era also devoted serious attention to landscapes. Unlike Reynolds, he was no great believer in an academic tradition and laughed at the fashion for history painting; an instinctive painter, he delighted in the poetry of paint. In his racy letters Gainsborough shows a warm-hearted and generous character and an independent mind. His comments on his own work and methods, as well as on some of the old masters, are very revealing and throw considerable light on contemporary views of art. "

41493,Simone Pignoni,1611,1698,"Italian painter and draughtsman. He is best known for his many pictures of voluptuous female nudes, which developed the morbidly sensual style of Francesco Furini. His Self-portrait (c. 1650; Florence, Uffizi), in which he depicts himself building up a rounded female form from a skeleton, conveys his fascination with the subject. He had an early education in Latin, followed by an apprenticeship in the workshop of the bookbinder Zanobi Pignoni, a close relative. Domenico Passignano, who frequented the workshop, suggested that Pignoni be apprenticed to Fabrizio Boschi (1570-1642), one of his own former pupils. Pignoni began to study under Boschi, but shortly moved to the workshop of Passignano and then spent a further period of study under Furini. Pignoni apparently had a late-life conversion to more pious painting. Among his more conventional works are a St Agatha Cured by St Peter (attributed) in the Museo Civico di Trieste. A St Louis Providing a Banquet for the Poor (c. 1682) now in the church of Santa Felicità in Florence, commissioned by Conte Luigi Gucciardini. A Madonna and Child in Glory with Archangels Sts Michael and Raphael in Battle Armor and San Antonio of Padua (1671) for the Cappella di San Michele in Santissima Annunziata. He painted an Allegory of Peace in Palazzo Vecchio. A Penitent Magdalen has been attributed to Pignoni is found in the Pitti Palace. In San Bartolomeo in Monteoliveto, he painted a Madonna appearing to Blessed Bernardo Tolomeo. "

Although his earliest efforts in drawing were encouraged, his parents violently objected when he decided to become a professional artist. To mollify them he worked for a time as a postal clerk in Paris while studying at the École des Beaux-Arts. In 1868 he left the civil service and was accepted into Alexandre Cabanel's atelier. During this apprenticeship, Bastien-Lepage won two prizes in drawing, and in 1870 he made his début at the Salon with a Portrait of a Young Man (untraced). In the Franco-Prussian War (1870-71) he joined a regiment of sharpshooters and was severely wounded in the chest. When he recovered he attempted unsuccessfully to find work as an illustrator. A pastiche of Watteau was accepted at the Salon in 1873, and two further canvases in 1874. In 1875 he won second place in the competition for the Prix de Rome. He was a close friend of Zola and painted in a naturalist style, comparable to that of Courbet and Millet. He was notably successful at the Salon of 1878. Between 1879 and 1882 he traveled annually to London where he met Burne-Jones and Clausen. In 1881 he traveled to Venice and in 1884 to Algier. He died of cancer in 1884. "

40514,Cesare Dandini,1596,1657,"Italian artist, part of a family of painters which made a significant contribution to the Florentine Baroque. The polished and elegant style of Cesare Dandini was continued by his younger brother Vincenzo Dandini. Their nephew Pietro Dandini was Vincenzo's pupil, and Pietro's two sons, Ottaviano (1681-1740) and Vincenzo (1686-1734), a Jesuit, worked as painters in Florence. Cesare Dandini was a precocious artist, who trained first with Francesco Curradi, briefly with Cristofano Allori and then with Domenico Passignano (who returned to Florence in 1616). Our scant knowledge of his life comes from Baldinucci, who wrote that he was an exceptionally beautiful youth (Curradi's model for numerous Madonnas) and was offended by the scurrilous activities in Allori's studio, a reaction that accords with the sense of refinement in his art. He matriculated in 1621 in the Accademia del Disegno; of his documented paintings, the earliest known is a Pietà (1625; Florence, SS Annunziata, sacristy). By 1631, the year in which he painted the Zerbino and Isabella (Florence, Uffizi) for the musician Giovanni Battista Severi and the Virgin and Saints for SS Annunziata, he had acquired many patrons, notably Lorenzo de' Medici. He developed a theatrical, idealized style that was at once veristic, classicizing, harmonious in form and colour and restrained in movement and expression. He shared with Florentine contemporaries Jacopo Vignali and Carlo Dolci a devotion to the style initiated in the 1590s by Lodovico Cigoli, Gregorio Pagani, Jacopo da Empoli, Passignano and Curradi and refined in the 1610s and 1620s by Matteo Rosselli, Giovanni Bilivert and Allori (who was perhaps the most influential for Cesare). His production included portraits in miniature on copper, salon pictures of half-length religious, secular and allegorical figures, which often appear to combine portraiture with thematic conceits, and large-scale portrayals of religious and literary themes. In his late works, such as the Conversion of Saul (1646-47; Vallombrosa, abbey church) and the Death of Cleopatra (private collection), he introduced more rhetorical gestures and animated movement, reminiscent of Pietro da Cortona and his Florentine contemporary Baldassare Franceschini.

42529,Pietro di Gottardo Gonzaga,1751,1831,"Italian theatrical designer. He studied in Venice and Milan as an architect. However, after meeting the stage designer Carlo Galli Bibiena, he choose the theatre, and worked as a stage designer in Milan (in La Scala). He went to St. Petersburg in 1792 and was admitted to the Directors Board of Imperial Theatres, which came under his leadership in 1827. He designed plays in The Bolshoy Theatre and various court theatres, starting with illusionistic techniques and evolving from Baroque to Romanticism. In addition to designing decorations for various court festivities, including the coronations of Emperors Pavel I, Alexander I, and Nicholas I, he also constructed fireworks. In 1792, he painted the exterior decoration of Prince Yusupov's Palace (not preserved). Between 1798 and 1799, he participated in the planning and decoration of the park in Pavlovsk, collaborating with architect V.F. Brenna, and taking part in painting the palace (Gonzaga Gallery) and pavilions (Peel Tower, The New Chalet, Turkish Tent). He designed unfinished projects, one for the Opera Theatre of the Mikhailovsky Castle (1799-1800), another for the Kazan Cathedral (1799), and a third for the theatre at Palace Square (1827). Retired in 1828, and was buried several years later at Volkovskoe Lutheran Cemetery in St. Petersburg. "

33939,Théodore Chassériau,1819,1856,"French painter and printmaker. In 1822 Chassériau moved with his family to Paris, where he received a bourgeois upbringing under the supervision of an older brother. A precociously gifted draughtsman, he entered Ingres's studio at the age of 11 and remained there until Ingres left to head the Académie de France in Rome in 1834. He made his Salon début in 1836 with several portraits and religious subjects, including Cain Accursed (Paris, private collection), for which he received a third-class medal. Among his many submissions in subsequent years were Susanna Bathing (1839, exhibited Salon 1839; Paris, Louvre), a Marine Venus (1838; exhibited Salon 1839; Paris, Louvre) and the Toilet of Esther (1841, exhibited Salon 1842; Paris, Louvre); these three paintings of nude female figures combine an idealization derived from Ingres with a sensuality characteristic of Chassériau. In the 1840s he conceived an admiration for Delacroix and attempted, with considerable success, to combine Ingres's classical linear grace with Delacroix's Romantic colour. His chief work was the decoration of the Cour des Comptes in the Palais d'Orsay, Paris, with allegorical scenes of Peace and War (1844-48), but these were almost completely destroyed by fire. There are other examples of his decorative work, however, in various churches in Paris. Chassériau was also an outstanding portraitist and painted nudes and North African scenes (he made a visit there in 1846). "

35551,Daniel Maclise,1806,1870,"Irish painter and caricaturist, active in London from 1827. An outstanding draughtsman, Maclise became the leading history painter of his period, his greatest works being two enormous murals in the House of Lords on The Meeting of Wellington and Blücher at Waterloo (completed 1861) and The Death of Nelson at Trafalgar (completed 1865). They were done in the water-glass technique and are poorly preserved (a sketch for the Nelson in the Walker Art Gallery in Liverpool gives an idea of the original colouring), but they are powerful works - fully coherent in spite of the huge numbers of figures involved - and they remain the most stirring examples of his heroic powers of design. Maclise was handsome, charming, and popular with fellow artists. Grandiose history painting was only one side to his talent, however, for he also excelled as a caricaturist, and is particularly noted for a series of character portraits of literary men and women. There are several examples of his conventional portraits in the National Portrait Gallery, London, including a well-known one of his close friend Charles Dickens (1839). "

He travelled in Italy. 1785-87, and in 1788 he settled in Berlin, where he became head of the Academy in 1816. His style was Neoclassical (he knew Canova in Italy), but retained a degree of Baroque liveliness. He was active mainly as a portraitist and tomb sculptor, but his best-known work is the quadriga (four-horse chariot) (1793) surmounting the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin, which was badly damaged in the Second World War. His finest achievement is perhaps the charming and sensitive group of The Princesses Luise and Frederika of Prussia (Staatliche Museen, Berlin, 1795-97). From the 1820s his sight deteriorated and he turned more to graphic work (he was a draughtsman, engraver, and lithographer) and to writing on art theory. He had three artist sons; Felix Schadow (1819-1861), Ridolfo Schadow and, most importantly, Wilhelm von Schadow. Wilhelm was in Italy 1811-19 and a member of the Nazarenes. He taught at the Berlin Academy, then in 1826 became Director of the Düsseldorf Academy, which he helped to make into a leading centre of history painting. "

Dominic Serres had at least five children: three daughters, all of whom were amateur painters (mostly in watercolours), and two sons, also painters: Dominic M. Serres (c. 1761-after 1804) and John Thomas Serres (1759-1825). Dominic Serres was strongly associated with the English school of painting, he became one of the founding members of the Royal Academy in 1768, and was later briefly (from 1792 until his death) its librarian. Born in Auch, Gascony, he was initially expected to train as a priest but instead travelled to Spain and became a ship's captain, sailing to Cuba. He was taken prisoner by the British navy towards the end of the 1740s and eventually settled in London in about 1758. He trained as a painter under Charles Brooking. Many of his paintings have naval themes. Working for a publisher documenting the events in the Seven Years' War (1756-1763), he painted a series of depictions including the capture of Havana (1762). He also painted events in the American War of Independence (1776-1783). In 1780, he was appointed Marine Painter to King George III. "

9253,Gaetano Gandolfi,1734,1802,"Painter, draughtsman, sculptor and etcher, part of an Italian family of artists. The work of the brothers Ubaldo Gandolfi and Gaetano Gandolfi and of the latter's son, Mauro Gandolfi, reflects the transition from late Bolognese Baroque through Neo-classicism and into early Italian Romanticism. During their period of collective productivity, from c. 1760 to c. 1820, the Gandolfi produced paintings, frescoes, drawings, sculptures and prints. Their drawings (examples by all three artists, Venice, Fondazione Cini) made an outstanding contribution to the great figurative tradition of Bolognese draughtsmanship that had begun with the Carracci. Their prolific output and their activity as teachers gave them considerable influence throughout northern Italy, except in Venice. One of Ubaldo's five children, Giovanni Battista Gandolfi (b 1762), trained at the Accademia Clementina, Bologna, but apart from a vault fresco signed and dated 1798 in the church of S Francesco in Bagnacavallo nothing is known of his adult career. A drawing (Paris, Fondacione Custodia) is signed Ubaldo Lorenzo Gandolfi, who may have been another son. Mauro's daughter, Clementina Gandolfi (b 1795), was an artist and amateur musician, and his son by a second marriage, Democrito Gandolfi (b 1796), studied with Antonio Canova but was an unsuccessful sculptor. He delivered a eulogy at Mauro's funeral and sculpted the portrait bust that stands on the tomb of Gaetano and Mauro in the Certosa di Bologna. Gaetano Gandolfi was a successful artist, whose oeuvre includes about 220 paintings, terracotta sculptures, etchings and a huge number of drawings. He was enrolled at the Accademia Clementina in Bologna by the age of 17 and claimed Felice Torelli and Ercole Lelli as his teachers. He had a distinguished academic career and between 1751 and 1756 won two medals for sculpture and four for drawing. His first documented commission was for drawings: between 1756 and 1760 he produced for private patrons a series of large finished red chalk copies (Bologna, Biblioteca Cassa di Risparmio; Windsor Castle, Royal Collection) of the classics of 17th-century painting. These and other early works are documented and dated in his manuscript autobiography, which, however, does not extend past c. 1769. His earliest known painting is the Calling of St James the Greater (1753; Piumazzo, nr Modena, parish church). The painting is close in style to the early work of his brother Ubaldo: highly finished, smooth and static, with low-key, muted colours. The figure types are the stereotyped ones of the Bolognese tradition. A surge of self-confidence is evident in the next datable paintings, the large St Jerome (1756) and St Mary Magdalene (1757; both Bazzano, oratory of the Suffraggio). From its beginnings, Gaetano's art was brilliant and individual, as can be seen in the Vision of St Jerome (private collection), a sketch of 1756 for the altarpiece in Bazzano, Oratorio del Suffragio. In the 1760s the impact of Venice, and Tiepolo in particular, is particularly noticeable in his frescoes such as those in the church of San Rocco, Bologna, where there is an emphasis on bravura effect in contrast to the firm design of Bolognese painting. Gaetano's art perhaps reached its apex in 1775-80 in the huge canvas of The Marriage of Cana (Bologna, Pinacoteca Nazionale) and the cupola frescoes for Santa Maria della Vita, Bologna. Here, he successfully achieved a complexity of design combined with a splendour of execution that in Settecento Italy was surpassed only by Tiepolo. He is rightly now considered one of the greatest Italian artists of the century. In later years, even before he visited London in 1788, Gaetano's art became increasingly neo-classical. By this time, both stylistically and thematically he seems to have been well aware of Giaquinto as well as artistic currents in France in the 1760s. Gaetano died playing bowls in the church field of S. Egidio, probably of a heart attack, although there is an alternative tradition that he was knocked on the head by a ball. "

54500,Desiderio da Settignano,1428,1464,"Florentine sculptor (real name: Desiderio de Bartolommeo di Francesco detto Ferro). Like most of his contemporaries he formed his style on Donatello's work of the 1430s. He learnt from Donatello the practice of carving in very low relief, and the lively, thick-set figures of children on the Singing Gallery made by Donatello for Florence Cathedral (1433-39) provided models for Desiderio's own reliefs of the Madonna and Child. Desiderio's artistic personality, however, was more delicate than Donatello's, and for refinement of handling he is unsurpassed by any Italian sculptor of his period. His only important public work was the tomb of the Florentine humanist and statesman Gregorio Marsuppini in Santa Croce (after 1453). This is architecturally dependent on the tomb of Leonardo Bruni by Bernardino Rossellino (probably Desiderio's teacher), executed for the same church about ten years earlier, but is sculpturally richer and more animated. His sensitive modelling is best exemplified in his portrait busts of women, good examples of which are in Florence (Bargello) and Washington (National Gallery of Art). "

37184,Robert William Vonnoh,1858,1933,"American painter. Known for portraits, figure studies, and outdoor views, he numbered among the first to introduce to the United States a style strongly indebted to French Impressionism. Born in Hartford, Connecticut, as a small child Robert William Vonnoh moved to Roxbury (now part of Boston). He completed four years of training at Boston's Massachusetts Normal Art School (now Massachusetts College of Art) in 1879 and two years later departed to study in Paris at the Académie Julian under Boulanger and Lefèbvre. He returned to Boston in 1883 but after four years of study at the Boston Museum School he embarked on a decisive sojourn in France. While residing in the artists' colony of Grèz-sur-Loing, south of Fontainebleau, he came to value immediate sensations and adopted the Impressionists' colourful, broken brushwork. His close-up 1888 studies of a poppy field rival the optical intensity, casual organization, and uninhibited brushwork of Monet's Giverny flowerbeds. Yet, in many other works Vonnoh retained the disciplined compositional structure and solid masses of his traditional training. Vonnoh returned to Boston in 1891 but soon accepted a teaching position at Philadelphia's Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, where he served as an influential teacher until the mid-1890s. (After 1918 he again taught there for several years.) Subsequently he resided primarily in New York but also spent periods elsewhere, particularly in France and in Old Lyme, Connecticut. He continued during summer escapes to paint landscapes, while during winters he specialized increasingly in portraits. His late landscapes, mostly painted in France, show greater restraint in colour and brushwork. From the mid-1920s diminished eyesight curtailed his artistic activity. Vonnoh died in Nice, France. In 1899 he married sculptor Bessie Potter Vonnoh (1872-1955). Known especially for graceful, intimate, small-scale bronzes, she specialized in themes of genteel domesticity centred on women and children. "

40810,Georges Seurat,1859,1891,"French painter. A key Post-Impressionist painter, Georges Seurat moved away from the apparent spontaneity and rapidity of Impressionism and developed a structured, more monumental art to depict modern urban life. For several of his large compositions, Seurat painted many small studies. Georges Seurat first studied art with Justin Lequien, a sculptor then attended the École des Beaux-Arts in 1878 and 1879. After a year of service at Brest Military Academy, he returned to Paris in 1880. He shared a small studio on the Left Bank with two student friends before moving to a studio of his own. For the next two years he worked at mastering the art of black-and-white drawing. He spent 1883 on his first major painting, a huge canvas titled Bathers at Asnières. After his painting was rejected by the Paris Salon, Seurat turned away from such establishments, instead allying with the independent artists of Paris. In 1884 he and other artists (including Maximilien Luce) formed the Société des Artistes Indépendants. There he met and befriended fellow artist Paul Signac. Seurat shared his new ideas about Pointillism with Signac, who subsequently painted in the same idiom. In the summer of 1884, Seurat began work on his masterpiece, A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte, which took him two years to complete. Seurat studied avant-garde painting techniques, especially Impressionism and the latest scientific theories pertaining to light and colour. From 1885 to 1886 he developed the divisionist technique. This new style, which consisted of systematically applied small touches of unmodulated colour, was based on contemporary optical theories of colour relationships. Two years after his first Neo-Impressionist work was shown at the Salon des Indépendants, Seurat exhibited A Sunday on La Grande Jatte at the eighth and final Impressionist group show in 1886. His disciplined technique exerted a considerable influence over Neo-Impressionist artists such as Camille Pissarro, Henri Edmond Cross, and Paul Signac. Seurat died in Paris on 29 March 1891 at the age of 31. The cause of his death is uncertain. His last ambitious work, The Circus, was left unfinished at the time of his death. Georges Seurat is chiefly remembered as the pioneer of the Neo-Impressionist technique commonly known as Divisionism, or Pointillism, an approach associated with a softly flickering surface of small dots or strokes of colour. His innovations derived from new quasi-scientific theories about colour and expression, yet the graceful beauty of his work is explained by the influence of very different sources. Initially, he believed that great modern art would show contemporary life in ways similar to classical art, except that it would use technologically informed techniques. Later he grew more interested in Gothic art and popular posters, and the influence of these on his work make it some of the first modern art to make use of such unconventional sources for expression. His success quickly propelled him to the forefront of the Parisian avant-garde. His triumph was short-lived, as after barely a decade of mature work he died at the age of only 31. But his innovations would be highly influential, shaping the work of artists as diverse as Vincent van Gogh and the Italian Futurists, while pictures like A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grand Jatte have since become widely popular icons.

His father was a wholesale merchant and the family enjoyed a good standard of living. His younger brother was the painter Svend Hammershøi (1873-1948). Hammershøi began his training at 8 and by the time he was in his mid-teens he was already studying at the Royal Academy of Art in Copenhagen. Towards the end of his study he also learnt at the Free Study School which offered a more liberal approach. His teacher was Peter Severin Krøyer. He married Ida Ilsted (1869-1949) in 1891 and she provided the inspiration for many of his future works and is often the lone figure seen in his paintings. They lived a relatively quiet life, apart from Ida's reported fiery temperament, and had no children. They traveled together throughout Europe, including Paris, Berlin and London. Later in his life he lived in the old merchant house at Strandgade in Copenhagen and he painted the interior of this house more than sixty times. Hammershøi died of throat cancer in 1916 in Copenhagen at the age of 52. Hammershøi painted portraits, landscapes and many room interiors which frequently contained a single figure that was seated or standing. Many of his paintings show empty rooms or often include the profile, or view from the back, of his wife in a long dark dress. These interior paintings always show rooms inside his own home and due to their popularity Hammershøi's other subjects have been slightly overshadowed. He has painted sublime landscapes and architectural pictures that emit a lonely, deserted and empty feeling. There are definite elements of modernism in his work from the use of a muted palette and his frequent use of exaggerated light to the creation of similar yet subtly different paintings. Yet it is the interiors that remain the most popular due to the way they emit a solitary atmosphere devoid of life but still providing a real emphasis on a feeling of space. "

After the latter's death Tacca completed a number of his works and succeeded him as sculptor to the Medici Grand Dukes of Tuscany. It was his technical and stylistic acumen in bronze, however that gained him the patronage of the Medici Dukes. He was granted the use for his lifetime of Giambologna studio by Cosimo II in 1616 and later served Ferdinand II as court artist in Spain. Tacca's works for the Medici include his masterpieces, the four Slaves at the foot of Bandini's statue of Ferdinand I de' Medici at Livorno. "

34028,John Singleton Copley,1738,1815,"American painter of portraits and historical subjects, generally acclaimed as the finest artist of colonial America. Little is known of Copley's boyhood. He developed within a flourishing school of colonial portraiture, and it was as a portraitist that he reached the high point of his art, and - as his Boston portraits later revealed - he gained an intimate knowledge of his New England subjects and milieu and was able to convey a powerful sense of physical entity and directness - real people seen as they are. From his stepfather, the limner and engraver Peter Pelham, Copley gained familiarity with graphic art as well as an early sense of vocation. Before he was 20 he was an accomplished draughtsman. To the Rococo portrait style derived from the English painter Joseph Blackburn he brought his own powers of imagination and a technical ability surpassing anyone painting in America at the time. Copley, in his portraits, made eloquent use of a Rococo device, the portrait d'apparat - portraying the subject with the objects associated with him in his daily life - that gave his work a liveliness and acuity not usually associated with 18th-century American painting. Although he was steadily employed with commissions from the Boston bourgeoisie, Copley wanted to test himself against the more exacting standards of Europe. In 1766, therefore, he exhibited Boy with a Squirrel at the Society of Artists in London. It was highly praised both by Sir Joshua Reynolds and by Copley's countryman Benjamin West. Copley married in 1769. Although he did not venture out of Boston except for a seven-month stay in New York City (June 1771-January 1772), he was urged by fellow artists who were familiar with his work to study in Europe. When political and economic conditions in Boston began to deteriorate (Copley's father-in-law was the merchant to whom the tea that provoked the Boston Tea Party was consigned), Copley left the country - never to return - in June 1774. In 1775 his wife, children, and several other family members arrived in London, and Copley established a home there in 1776. His ambitions in Europe went beyond portraiture; he was eager to make a success in the more highly regarded sphere of historical painting. In his first important work, Watson and the Shark (1778), Copley used what was to become one of the great themes of 19th-century Romantic art, the struggle of man against nature. He was elected to the Royal Academy in 1779. Although his English paintings grew more academically sophisticated and self-conscious, in general they lacked the extraordinary vitality and penetrating realism of his Boston portraits. Toward the end of his life, his physical and mental health grew worse. Though he continued to paint with considerable success until the last few months of his life, he was obsessed by the sale (at a loss) of his Boston property and by his increasing debts. "

41344,Daniel de Blieck,1625,1673,"Dutch painter and architect who specialised in architectural paintings. He was probably a pupil of architectural painter Dirck van Delen. He became a member of the Middelburg Guild of Saint Luke c. 1648 and was deacon of the Guild in 1664-1665 and 1668. He stayed in England from 1658 to 1661. When the governing body of Zeeland decided to mint coins mechanically, de Blieck was commissioned to produce drawings on the production of the necessary equipment. He knew the equipment in Paris and had made drawings of the minting equipment in Dordrecht. The building of the minting machines was not without problems, and de Blieck made a number of trips to Antwerp, Rotterdam and The Hague as supervisor for repairs and parts. He principally painted architectural studies, but is also known for some portraits. His imaginary architectural paintings of church interiors were in the style of the Flemish painter Hendrick Aerts (active c. 1600), but under the influence of architectural painters of the Delft school such as Hendrick Cornelisz. van Vliet, he developed a more realistic style around 1650. De Blieck was also an architect but little is known about his work in this field. He designed a new warehouse for the Dutch East India Company. "

He was the son of a Munich goldsmith, Conrad Schwarz (active 1540s), and was apprenticed to Hans II Bocksberger (c. 1530-after 1583) from 1560 to c. 1566. In 1568 he worked on festive decorations for the marriage of Prince William (later Duke) of Bavaria and Duchess Renata of Lorraine together with Hans Mielich, the master in charge, and Hans Ostendorfer II (d. ca. 1570). He also assisted Mielich on paintings for the High Altar (1560-72; in situ) of the Liebfrauenkirche, Ingolstadt. In 1569 he was awarded his master's certificate and citizenship of Munich. Between 1570 and 1573 he was in Italy, mainly in Venice, though he did spend some time in Padua with Lambert Sustris. After his return in 1573 he was first appointed Town Painter in Munich and the following year court painter to Duke Albert IV, as Mielich's successor. The façade paintings praised by Sandrart on the merchant's house at Kauffingerstrasse 4 (Rape of the Sabine Women, drawing; Stuttgart, Staatsgalerie), on the Senger brewery in Burgstrasse and elsewhere, partially known through drawings made after them, were executed in this period. In the 1570s he also depicted subjects from Classical mythology (e.g. the Rape of Proserpine; Cambridge, Fitzwilliam Museum) and painted portraits. "

40555,Domenichino,1581,1641,"Domenichino (Domenico Zampieri), Bolognese painter. He was Annibale Carracci's favourite pupil and one of the most important upholders of the tradition of Bolognese classicism. After studying with Calvaert and Lodovico Carracci he went to Rome (1602) and joined the colony of artists working under Annibale Carracci at the Palazzo Farnese. His only undisputed work there is the Maiden with the Unicorn, a charming, gentle fresco over the entrance of the Gallery. By the second decade of the century he was established as Rome's leading painter and had a succession of major decorative commissions, among them scenes from the life of St Cecilia in San Luigi dei Francesi (1613-14). The dignified frieze-like composition of the figures reflects his study of Raphael's tapestries, and in turn influenced Poussin. The frescos in the pendentives and apse of Sant'Andrea della Valle (1624-8), his chief work of the 1620s. show a move away from this strict classicism towards an ampler Baroque style; but compared with his rival Lanfranco (who at this time was overtaking him in popularity) Domenichino never abandoned the principles of clear, firm drawing for the sake of more painterly effects. In 1631 Domenichino moved to Naples, and in his ceiling frescos of the San Gennaro chapel in the cathedral he made even greater concessions to the fashionable Baroque. He met with considerable hostility in Naples from jealous local artists and was forced to flee precipitately in 1634. He later returned, but died before completing his work in the cathedral. Domenichino was important in fields other than monumental fresco decoration, particularly as an exponent of ideal landscape, in which he formed the link between Annibale Carracci and Claude (four of his landscapes are in the Louvre). He was one of the finest draughtsmen of his generation (the Royal Library at Windsor Castle has a superb collection of his drawings) and also an excellent portraitist (Monsignor Agucchi, City Art Gallery, York, c.1610). In the 18th century his reputation was enormous - his Last Communion of St Jerome (Vatican, 1614) was generally regarded as one of the greatest pictures ever painted - but he fell from grace in the 19th century along with other Bolognese painters under the scathing attacks of Ruskin.

42092,Alonso Berruguete,1485,1561,"Spanish sculptor and painter, the son of Pedro Berruguete, who became the major Spanish sculptor of the 16th century. He was trained in Italy and brought back Italian Mannerist ideas, both in sculpture and in painting. He went to Florence about 1504, where he saw and copied Michelangelo's lost cartoon for the Battle of Cascina (he is even mentioned in Michelangelo's letters). He may have been in Rome before returning to Florence for about 5 years before his final return to Spain in 1517. He was, therefore, acquainted with the early work of Pontormo and Rosso at the very beginning of Mannerism. His own work as a painter is close to Rosso, and he probably finished the Coronation of the Virgin (Paris, Louvre) which was left incomplete by Filippino Lippi at his death in 1504. He was active in Spain principally as a sculptor on such works as the altar of the Irish College, Salamanca (1529-32) and especially the choir stalls in Toledo Cathedral (on the Epistle side), executed 1539-43. These works, like his paintings, show a combination of the influences of Leonardo da Vinci, Andrea del Sarto and Raphael. He had an extremely successful career, being made Painter to the King on his return from Italy and ennobled in 1559. Other works attributed to him are in Arezzo, Budapest, Florence (Uffizi), Munich and Rome (Borghese). An engraving, possibly unique, is in London (British Museum). "

His historical subjects are admirable, particularly those of the easel size. He painted architectural views of noted places in Venice, embellishing them with figures, beautifully arranged, and imagined with considerable ease and symmetry. He also produced many portraits. "

Pietro was one  of the most accomplished glassmakers working in Venice in the 19th century. He made mirrors as well as lamps and window panes decorated with filigree and aventurine glass. Filigree is an opaque white or coloured glass which appears as swirling threads or spirals, and aventurine is a coloured glass which is made shiny with the addition of small flakes of gold or copper. They are both methods of glass ornamentation that died out, but were revived again by Bigaglia, and then later used in paperweight making. Bigaglia is known to have been one of the first Venetians to make paperweights. There are weights with his signature that are dated between 1845 and 1847. Bigaglia exhibited the first signed and dated millefiori paperweights at the Vienna Industrial Exposition in 1845. His work was shown again at the Murano Glass Museum in 1864 at the first big exhibit of Venetian and Muranese glassmakers. "

41651,Andrea Andreani,1558,1629,"Italian woodcutter and printmaker. He is known especially for his chiaroscuro printing, a technique developed in the early 16th century to facilitate shading. In this technique, several woodblocks are used for the same print, each block engraved to produce a different tone of the same colour. Andreani was active in Florence (1584-85), in Siena (1586-93), and in Mantua (1599). Between 1602 and 1610 he appears in contemporary documents as a publisher of prints that were not of his own design. All of Andreani's known woodcuts, in fact, are after the paintings of other artists, especially the 15th-century Mannerists Giambologna and Domenico Beccafumi and the Venetian painter Jacopo Ligozzi. The best known of Andreani's works are 12 large woodcuts representing the Trionfo di Giulio Cesare (Triumph of Julius Caesar) and a series of prints reproducing nine sequential canvases by Andrea Mantegna. The several sections of this work were intended to be pasted together or mounted as a single frieze; each print has an individual character yet fits into its place in the unified whole. "

55995,Wilhelm Leibl,1844,1900,"German painter, draughtsman and etcher. In 1861 he abandoned his apprenticeship as a locksmith in order to train as a precision instrument maker, though a month or so later he decided to train as an artist, at first under the Cologne history painter and writer Hermann Becker (1817-1885). In 1863 he moved to Munich; he studied there from March 1864, at the Akademie der Bildenden Künste, initially under Philipp von Foltz and Alexander Straehuber, drawing from plaster casts, and later in Hermann Anschütz's painting class. Here, Arthur von Ramberg (1819-1875) stimulated Leibl's sensitivity to colour; and Karl Theodor von Piloty encouraged him to observe reality and incorporate its lessons boldly into compositions on historical themes. From the start, however, Leibl tended to think of his pictures in terms of form rather than content. While at the Akademie he first reached a standard of excellence with his draughtsmanship, which is notable for its directness and objectivity. As an artist, Leibl's early works were not especially promising. However, as occurred throughout his career, a long period of mediocrity was crowned by an unexpected masterpiece, such as his portrait drawing of Aunt Josepha (c. 1864; Cologne, Wallraf-Richartz-Museum). This is particularly striking for Leibl's use of the hands to add to the expression of the sitter's character and mood, a device he was to use frequently in later work. In Munich, Leibl supplemented the teaching of the Akademie by studying the works of the Old Masters in the Alte Pinakothek: he paid particular attention to painters of the Baroque period such as van Dyck, Cornelis de Vos and Rubens, and also to other great masters of portraiture such as Frans Hals and Velázquez. The presentation of the subject found in such works is reflected in Leibl's portrait of Frau Gedon (1869; Munich, Neue Pinakothek). When the work was shown at the Grossen Internationale Kunstausstellung in Munich in 1869 it was singled out as the best oil painting of the exhibition by Gustave Courbet and, as a result, Leibl was honoured with an invitation to Paris, where he arrived on 13 November 1869. In Paris, Leibl looked at the recent work of French painters, especially that of Courbet and Manet, and the influence of both of these and the Old Masters is to be found throughout the rest of his life. Leibl painted a number of captivating works at this time, including Company at Table (1872-73; Cologne, Wallraf-Richartz-Museum) and two portraits of types rather than named individuals, the Old Parisienne and the Cocotte (both 1869-70; Cologne, Wallraf-Richartz-Museum). He left Munich to paint the rural people of Bavaria, owing much in his technique to an understanding of Holbein's works. His most famous picture, Three Women in Church marks the height of meticulous naturalism but is also a subtly composed study. "

Paul went to live with his brother at Windsor Park, where Thomas held the position of Deputy Ranger (they did many views of Windsor and its environment, and the Royal Library at Windsor Castle has an outstanding Standby collection). Their work is similar in many respects, but Paul was more versatile as well as a better artist, his work including lively figure subjects as well as an extensive range of landscape subjects. In his later work he often used body-colour (he also sometimes painted in oils) and he was the first professional artist in England to publish aquatints (1775). He was singled out by Gainsborough as the only contemporary English landscape artist who painted 'real views from nature' instead of artificial Picturesque compositions. Sandby has rather unjustifiable called the 'father of watercolour art', but certainly his distinction won prestige for the medium. He was a founder member of the Royal Academy and his brother was its first Professor of Architecture. "

36107,Paolo Pagani,1651,1716,"Italian painter, a Lombard artist most often associated with the visual traditions of his adopted city, Venice. Although Pagani was described as a painter 'dello stato Milanese' in 1719, most of his working life was spent in Venice. He was already in Venice by 1677 and received the most influential of his artistic training there, most likely in the studio of Pietro Liberi. In 1685 a Paolo Pagani appears in the city's Registro dei Pittori and his most important Venetian works, among them Abraham and Isaac and Hagar and Ishmael in the Palazzo Salvioni, were painted around this time. Pagani traveled to Vienna in 1690 and, by 1692, had completed a commission for the Archbishop of Liechtenstein to paint one of the residential rooms in Kromerz and a series of large frescos in the monastery at Welehrad. He returned to Castello Valsolda, his native village on the Lake of Lugano, in 1697 to paint the Assumption of the Virgin in the Chiesa San Martino. After 1701, he painted two important altarpieces for the Capuchins of Chiusa and a Martyrdom of San Liborio in San Marco in Milan. He died in Milan in 1716 and his influence can be seen in the work of his Venetian pupil, Giovanni Antonio Pellegrini, the young Piazzetta, and Giula Lama. Among his most famous paintings are The Penitent Magdalen in Dresden and Roman Charity in a Genoese private collection. "

44668,Laurent Cars,1699,1771,"French printmaker, print publisher and print-seller. Early in his life his family removed to Paris. His father, Jean-François Cars (1661-1730), an engraver and publisher, was his first teacher. He next studied painting under Joseph Christophe (1662-1748) and François Lemoyne and then completed his studies in engraving under Nicolas-Henry Tardieu. In 1729 he was approved (agréé) by the Académie Royale and on 31 December 1733 was received (reçu), on presentation of the engraved portraits of Michel Anguier after Gabriel Revel and of Sébastien Bourdon after Hyacinthe Rigaud. From 1750 he gradually abandoned engraving in favour of print-selling, particularly those of his father's collection. In 1757 he was appointed a Conseiller. His work included nearly 190 prints; he engraved portraits, historical and mythological subjects after Lemoyne, such as Hercules and Omphale and the Bath of Iris, and genre subjects after Watteau, such as Figures de différents caractères and Fêtes vénitiennes (generally considered Cars's masterpiece). He also engraved after Chardin (e.g. the Bird-song Organ) and Greuze, among others. Cars illustrated Molière's Oeuvres with engravings after Boucher (1734) and Jean de la Fontaine's Fables choisies after Oudry (1755-59). He also contributed prints to the Galerie de Versailles (1753). He was among the best reproductive engravers of his time; his design was masterly and his handling fluid and expressive, and such contemporaries as Charles-Nicolas Cochin le fils and Louis-Simon Lempereur stressed that he was an interpreter and not merely a copyist. His numerous pupils included Jacques-Firmin Beauvarlet, Jean-Jacques Flipart, François Flipart and Augustin de Saint-Aubin. His portrait by Cochin was engraved in 1750 by Saint-Aubin; his portrait by Jean-Baptiste Perronneau was engraved in 1759 by Simon-Charles Miger (1736-1820). "

(The remaining works in Orvieto are now in the Museo del Duomo.) Nebbia and Muziano became active in many late 16th-century projects in Rome. They, together with other Mannerist painters, decorated the Gregorian Chapel in the St Peter's Basilica during the administration of Gregory XIII (1572-1585). During the papacy of Pope Sixtus V (1585-1590), Nebbia and Giovanni Guerra, another assistant to Muziano, together managed the two major fresco decorations commissioned by the pope: the construction and decoration of the Capella Sistina at Santa Maria Maggiore and the refurbishment of the Scala Santa and the chapel of St Lawrence found adjacent to the Lateran palace and San Giovanni in Laterano. Numerous preliminary drawings by Nebbia exist for these frescoes. In the project at Santa Maria Maggiore starting in 1586, the following painters are traditionally listed who were active in the fresco decoration: Hendrick van den Broek, Angelo from Orvieto, Ercolino from Bologna, Salvatore Fontana, Lattanzio Mainardi, Ferdinando Sermei, Giacomo Stella, Giovanni Battista Pozzo, and Paris Nogari. The decoration aptly for the church and a chapel which held the relic of the Nativity (the original Presepe or manger crib) focused on scenes of the life of the Virgin. In 1603-1604, he moved to Milan where he worked for Federico Borromeo painting a series of frescoes on the life of the Blessed Carlo Borromeo for various sites, including the Collegio Borromeo in Pavia, the Collegiata di Arona, and the Palazzo Borromeo on Isola Bella.

33539,Francesco Bartolozzi,1727,1815,"Italian engraver. He was the son of Gaetano Bartolozzi, a goldsmith, with whom he trained before entering the Accademia di Belle Arti in Florence. There he studied under Giovanni Domenico Ferretti and Ignazio Hugford. In Florence he studied drawing and painting and formed a lifelong friendship with Cipriani, most of whose plates he later engraved. He is said to have become an adept painter of miniatures, watercolours and pastels, and an accomplished draughtsman; but he soon concentrated on engraving. In 1764 he went to London, where he became one of the founder members of the Royal Academy (admitted as a painter, as engravers were not originally eligible). He was responsible for the vogue in England of the stipple technique of engraving, which greatly improved methods of reproduction. He engraved the works of many of his leading contemporaries, such as Copley, Kauffmann, and Reynolds, but he was also celebrated for prints after the Old Masters. His output was enormous and he had many assistants and pupils. In 1802 he moved to Lisbon to become director of the Academy. "

Around 1592, the year of his marriage to Mayke van Bracht of the famous book printer family, Van de Velde was appointed writing master at Rotterdam's Latin School. At the same time, he ran a school at his own home training youngsters for a commercial career. Taking leave of his school, Van de Velde moved to Haarlem in 1620. There again he taught at the local Latin School. Van de Velde's eldest son, Jan van de Velde II became a leading engraver, draughtsman and painter in the seventeenth century. Jan van de Velde III (Jan Jansz. van de Velde), the son of Jan van de Velde II, was a still-life painter. "

28375,Rogier van der Weyden,1399,1464,"Flemish painter (French Rogier de le Pasture) who, with the possible exception of Jan van Eyck, was the most influential northern European artist of his time. Though most of his work was religious, he produced secular paintings (now lost) and some sensitive portraits. Rogier was the son of a master cutler, and his childhood must have been spent in the comfortable surroundings of the rising class of merchants and craftsmen. He may even have acquired a university education, for in 1426 he was honoured by the city as ""Maistre (Master) Rogier de le Pasture"" and began his painting career only the next year at the rather advanced age of 27. It was then, on March 5, 1427, that Rogier enrolled as an apprentice in the workshop of Robert Campin, the foremost painter in Tournai and dean of the painters' guild. Rogier remained in Campin's atelier for five years, becoming an independent master of the guild on Aug. 1, 1432. From Campin, Rogier learned the ponderous, detailed realism that characterizes his earliest paintings, and so alike, in fact, are the styles of these two masters that connoisseurs still do not agree on the attribution of certain works. But the theory that the entire sequence of paintings credited to Campin (who, like Rogier, did not sign his panels) are actually from the brush of the young Rogier cannot be maintained. Careful study of secure works by Rogier and by his colleague in Campin's workshop, Jacques Daret, permit scholars to reestablish a basic series of works by the older master and to distinguish the style of these from that of Rogier. Campin was not the only source of inspiration in Rogier's art. Jan van Eyck, the great painter from Bruges, also profoundly affected the developing artist, introducing elegance and subtle visual refinements into the bolder, Campinesque components of such early paintings by Rogier as St. Luke Painting the Virgin. Although as an apprentice Rogier must certainly have met Jan van Eyck when the latter visited Tournai in 1427, it was more likely in Bruges, where Rogier may have resided between 1432 and 1435, that he became thoroughly acquainted with van Eyck's style. By 1435, Rogier, now a mature master, settled in Brussels, the native city of his wife, Elizabeth Goffaert, whom he had married in 1426. The next year he was appointed city painter; and it was from this time that he began to use the Flemish translation of his name (van der Weyden). Rogier remained in Brussels the rest of his life, although he never completely severed his ties with Tournai. He was commissioned to paint a mural (now destroyed) for the town hall of Brussels showing famous historical examples of the administration of justice. During this same period, around 1435-40, he completed the celebrated panel of the Descent from the Cross for the chapel of the Archers' Guild of Louvain. In this deposition there is evident a tendency to reduce the setting of a scene to a shallow, shrinelike enclosure and to orchestrate a rich diversity of emotions. These devotional qualities are even more striking in Rogier's works of the 1440s such as the twin Granada-Miraflores altarpieces and the Last Judgment Polyptych in Beaune, Fr. (Hôtel-Dieu). In these the settings are stark, the figures are delicate Gothic types, and the action, though stilled, is exquisitely expressive. The removal of Rogier's art from concern with outward appearances and his return to medieval conventions is surprising; for it was during this decade that Rogier's international reputation was secured and commissions increased from noblemen such as Philip the Good, duke of Burgundy, and his powerful chancellor, Nicolas Rolin. Rogier may well have also been influenced by the writings of Thomas à Kempis, the most popular theologian of the era, whose ""practical mysticism,"" like Rogier's painting, stressed empathetic response to episodes from the lives of Mary, Christ, and the saints. Perhaps as an extension of a journey to install the Last Judgment Altarpiece in Rolin's chapel at Beaune or possibly to obtain a plenary indulgence for his daughter Margaret, one of Rogier's four children, who had died that year, the renowned painter visited Rome during the Jubilee of 1450. He was warmly received in Italy. Praise from the Humanist Bartolomeo Fazio and the eminent theologian Nicholas of Cusa is recorded; Rogier also received commissions from the powerful Este family of Ferrara and the Medici of Florence. He painted a portrait of Francesco d'Este (originally thought to be Leonello d'Este), and his painting of the Madonna and Child that still remains in Florence (Uffizi) bears the arms and patron saints of the Medici. While on his pilgrimage, Rogier apparently tutored Italian masters in painting with oils, a technique in which Flemish painters of the time were particularly adept. He also seems to have learned a great deal from what he viewed. Although he was primarily attracted to the conservative painters Gentile da Fabriano and Fra Angelico, whose medievalizing styles paralleled his own, Rogier was also acquainted with more progressive trends. In the St John Altarpiece and the Seven Sacraments Triptych, executed between 1451 and 1455, shortly after Rogier's return north, his characteristic austerity is tempered by his recollection of the more robust Italian styles; and, in both, the panels are unified from a single point of view. Despite this enrichment, however, Rogier's conceptions remained essentially iconic: he pushed the figures into the foreground and isolated them from their surroundings as subjects for devotion. The last 15 years of his life brought Rogier the rewards due an internationally famous painter and exemplary citizen. He received numerous commissions, which he carried out with the assistance of a large workshop that included his own son Peter and his successor as city painter, Vranck van der Stockt, a mediocre imitator. Even before his death, however, Rogier's impact extended far beyond his immediate associates. The influence of his expressive but technically less intricate style eclipsed that of both Campin and van Eyck. Every Flemish painter of the succeeding generation - Petrus Christus, Dierik Bouts, Hugo van der Goes, and Hans Memling (who may have studied in Rogier's atelier) - depended on his formulations; and, during the 16th century, Rogierian ideas were transformed and revitalized by Quentin Massys and Bernard van Orley. Rogier's art was also a vehicle for transporting the Flemish style throughout Europe, and during the second half of the 15th century his influence dominated painting in France, Germany, and Spain. Nevertheless, the fame of Rogier van der Weyden quickly waned, and no painting by him had been signed or dated. By the end of the 16th century the biographer Carel van Mander had referred mistakenly to two Rogiers in Het Schilderboek (1603; ""Book of Painters""), and by the middle of the 19th century his fame and art had all but been forgotten. Only through a meticulous evaluation of the documents have scholars over the past century been able to reconstruct Rogier's work and to restore the reputation of one of 15th-century Flanders' leading masters.

41221,Jan Both,1613,1652,"Dutch painter, with Nicolaes Berchem the most celebrated of the Italianate landscape painters. He came from Utrecht, where he studied with Bloemaert before moving to Italy for a period of about four years, c.1637-41. Although he died young, his output was large, but none of the more than 300 paintings attributed to him can be convincingly dated to his Italian sojourn. His landscapes are typically peopled by peasants driving cattle or travellers gazing on Roman ruins in the light of the evening sun. Such contemporary scenes were an innovation, for Claude Lorraine and the earlier Dutch painters of the Italian countryside had populated it with biblical or mythological figures. They express the yearning of northerners for the light and idyllic life of the south, and proved immensely popular with collectors, not least in England, helping to shape ideas about Italy for two centuries. Jan's brother Andries (c.1612-41) lived with him in Rome 1639-41; they are said to have collaborated, but Andries is best known for paintings and drawings of lively peasant scenes that have little in common with Jan's idyllic tone. He was drowned in an accident in Venice."

He spent much of his early career engaged in the restoration of sculptures, although he also produced significant original work at this time. He had become fully established by the late 1590s, and his predominance as a sculptor in Florence was assured by the move of his rival, Pietro Francavilla, to France in 1601. Of a secondary nature, Caccini's rather obscurely documented work as an architect began in the 1590s and continued until his death. "

41364,Adriaen van de Velde,1636,1672,"Velde, van de, family of Dutch marine painters and landscapists of the 17th century. Willem van de Velde the Elder (circa 1611-93) Dutch marine painter. He was the son of a naval captain, his brother was a skipper of merchant vessels, and he himself spent part of his youth as a sailor before devoting himself to the drawing and painting of ships. His pictures, which are frequently grisailles, contain faithful and detailed portraits of ships (of much value to naval historians) and for a time he was an official artist for the Dutch fleet. In 1672, when the Netherlands were at war with England, he went to London and entered the service of Charles II; why he left his country at a critical moment in its fortunes remains a mystery. Willem van de Velde the Younger (1633-1707) Willem's son, he is one of the most illustrious of all marine painters. He was the pupil of his father and Simon de Vlieger. Like his father, he gave very accurate portrayals of ships, but is distinguished from him by his feeling for atmosphere and majestic sense of composition. He left Amsterdam for England with his father in 1672 and in 1674 Charles II gave them a yearly retaining fee of 100 pounds each; the father received his ""for taking and making draughts of seafights"" and the son ""for putting the said draughts into colours for our own particular use"". They did not switch their allegiance to England completely; both subsequently painted pictures of naval battles for the Dutch as well as the English market. Willem the Younger's influence, however, was particularly great in England, where the whole tradition of marine painting stemmed from him. Adriaen van de Velde (1636-72) Brother of Willem the Younger, was a prolific artist in spite of his short life. His father and Jan Wijnants were his teachers. He painted various types of landscapes (most notably some fresh and atmospheric beach scenes) and also religious and mythological works, portraits, and animal pictures. He also did exceptionally fine etchings of landscapes with cattle and often painted the figures into the landscapes of other artists, notably Hobbema and Ruisdael. "

36259,Nicolas Poussin,1584,1665,"French painter, a leader of pictorial classicism in the Baroque period. Except for two years as court painter to Louis XIII, he spent his entire career in Rome. His paintings of scenes from the Bible and from Greco-Roman antiquity influenced generations of French painters, including Jacques-Louis David, J.-A.-D. Ingres, and Paul Cézanne. Childhood and early travels Poussin was born in a small hamlet on the Seine River, the son of small farmers. He was educated at the nearby town of Les Andelys, and he apparently did not show any interest in the arts until the painter Quentin Varin visited the village in 1612 to produce several paintings for the Church of Le Grand Andely. Poussin's interest in the arts was awakened, and he decided to become a painter. As this was impossible in Les Andelys, he left his home, going first to Rouen and then to Paris to find a suitable teacher. His poverty and ignorance made this search very difficult. He found no satisfactory master and studied at different times under several minor painters. During this period Poussin endured great hardships and had to return to his paternal home, where he arrived ill and humiliated. Recovering after a year, Poussin again set out for Paris, not only to continue his studies but also to pursue another aim. While previously in Paris, he had been exposed to the art of the Italian High Renaissance through reproductions of Raphael's paintings. These engravings, according to his biographer Giovanni Battista Passeri, inspired him to go to Rome, which was then the centre of the European art world. But only in 1624 was Poussin successful in reaching Rome, with the help of Giambattista Marino, the Italian court poet to Marie de Médicis. First Roman period Marino commissioned Poussin to make a series of mythological drawings illustrating Ovid's Metamorphoses. Poussin meanwhile experimented with various painting styles then current in Rome, an important influence being that of the Bolognese painter Domenichino. Poussin's culminating work of this period was a large altarpiece for St. Peter's representing the Martyrdom of St. Erasmus (1629). But it was a comparative failure with the artistic community in Rome, and Poussin never again tried to compete with the Italian masters of the Baroque style on their own ground. Thereafter he would paint only for private patrons and would confine his work to formats rarely larger than five feet in length. Between Poussin's arrival in Rome in 1624 and his departure for France in 1640 he came to know many of Rome's most influential people, among them Cassiano dal Pozzo, secretary to Cardinal Barberini, whose rich collection of ancient Roman artifacts had a decisive influence upon Poussin's art. Through Pozzo, who became Poussin's patron, the French painter became a fervent admirer of ancient Roman civilization. From about 1629 to 1633 Poussin took his themes from classical mythology and from Torquato Tasso, and his painterly style became more romantic and poetic under the influence of such Venetian masters as Titian. Such examples of his work at this time as The Arcadian Shepherds and Rinaldo and Armida have sensuous, glowing colours and manage to communicate a true feeling for pagan antiquity. In the mid-1630s Poussin began deliberately to turn toward Raphael and Roman antiquity for his inspiration and to evolve the purely classical idiom that he was to retain for the rest of his life. He also began painting religious themes once more. He began with stories that offered a good pageant, such as The Worship of the Golden Calf and The Rape of the Sabine Women. He went on to choose incidents of deeper moral significance in which human reactions to a given situation constitute the main interest. The most important works that exemplify this phase are those in the series of Seven Sacraments painted in 1634-42 for Pozzo. While other artists painted in the style of the Roman Baroque, Poussin tried in these works to fashion a style marked by classical clarity and monumentality. This style was inspired by Roman pre-Christian architecture and Latin books on moral conduct, as well as by the nobility and greatness of Raphael's works, which, as he believed, had renewed the spirit of antiquity. Painter to Louis XIII Between 1638 and 1639 Poussin's achievements in Rome attracted the attention of the French court. Louis XIII's powerful minister Cardinal Richelieu tried to persuade Poussin to return to France. Eventually Poussin reluctantly acceded to this request, journeying to Paris in 1640. Though received with great honours, Poussin nevertheless soon found himself in trouble with the ministers of the king as well as with the French artists, whom he met with the utmost arrogance. He was offered commissions for kinds of work he was not used to nor really qualified to execute, including altarpieces and the decoration of the Grande Galérie of the Louvre palace. What he produced did not elicit the praise he expected, so he left Paris in defeat in 1642 and returned to Rome. Unfortunately he did not live to see his own style of painting accepted and eventually glorified by the French Academy in the late 17th century. Second Roman period Many of Poussin's paintings on religious and ancient Roman subjects done in the 1640s and '50s are concerned with moments of crisis or difficult moral choice, and his heroes are those who reject vice and the pleasures of the senses in favour of virtue and the dictates of reason - e.g., Coriolanus, Scipio, Phocion, and Diogenes. Poussin's painterly style was consciously calculated to express such a mood of austere rectitude: such solemn religious works as Holy Family on the Steps (1648) exhibit only a few figures, painted in harsh colours against the severest possible background. In the landscapes Poussin began painting at this time, such as Landscape with the Body of Phocion Carried out of Athens and Landscape with Polyphemus, the disorder of nature is reduced to the order of geometry, and the forms of trees and shrubs are made to approach the condition of architecture. The composition in these paintings is worked out very carefully and has an unusual clarity of structure. Poussin's health declined from 1660 onward, and early in 1665 he ceased to paint. He died that year and was buried in San Lorenzo in Lucina, his Roman parish church. Assessment Poussin believed in reason as the guiding principle of art, yet his figures are never merely cold or lifeless. They may resemble figures used by Raphael or ancient Roman sculptures in their poses, but they retain a strange and unmistakable vitality of their own. Even in Poussin's late period, when all movement, including gesture and facial expression, had been reduced to a minimum, his forms harmoniously combine vitality with intellectual order. "

Szinyei's early sketches already revealed his search for new ways of expression. His friendship with his master, as well as that with Wilhelm Leibl and Hans Makart, left no mark on his plein-air painting. The sketches made in 1869 for The Swing and Clothes Drying (Hungarian National Gallery, Budapest) are the earliest examples of Hungarian and Central European Impressionism. He constantly wanted to visit Paris, but did not get there until 1908. In this way be developed his revolutionary artistic concept on his own, quite independently from the French painters. The coloration based on the harmonious effect of complementary and contrasting colours and colour values full of light is fully developed in his main work Picnic in May (1873). His painting Bath House won him a medal at the 1873 World Fair in Vienna but Picnic in May, similarly to his later works, was met with a general rejection. In 1873 he returned to his family estate and painted less and less. It was not until 1896 that his work was gradually acknowledged; then he returned to the art life and won several gold and silver medal (1896 Budapest, 1900 Paris, 1901 Munich, 1904 Saint Louis, 1910 Berlin, 1911 Rome); his self-portrait painted in 1897 was asked for by the Uffizi Gallery of Florence. As Member of the Parliament, he fought for the modernization of art education after 1897 be continued to do so after, 1905, now in the capacity of the Director of the Academy of Fine Arts of Budapest. In 1908. in the company of others, he founded the first society of modern art in Hungary, the Circle of Hungarian Impressionists and Naturalists. In the last phase of his career he mainly painted landscapes. "

35834,Berthe Morisot,1841,1895,"French painter and printmaker. As the child of upper middle-class parents, she was expected to be a skilled amateur artist and was thus given appropriate schooling. In 1857 she attended drawing lessons with Geoffroy-Alphonse Chocarne (active 1838-1857), but in 1858 she and her sister Edma left to study under Joseph-Benoit Guichard, a pupil of Ingres and Delacroix. In the same year they registered as copyists in the Louvre, copying Veronese and Rubens. The sisters were introduced to Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot in 1861 and took advice from him and subsequently from his pupil, Achille-François Oudinot (1820-1891). Through these artists they became familiar with current debates on naturalism and began to work en plein air, painting at Pontoise, Normandy and Brittany. She formed a close friendship with Manet, who became her brother-in-law, and she served as model for several of his best-known paintings. The two greatly influenced each other's artistic development. Her own later work inclined toward pure Impressionism in its rendering of light, while retaining an unusual smoothness of brushwork. Her paintings formed an important addition to all but one Impressionist exhibition from 1874 through 1885. Her most notable works, including Young Woman at the Dance (1880; Paris) and La Toilette (Art Institute, Chicago), are painted in clear, luminous colours. Her early subject matter included landscapes and marine scenes; later she most frequently painted tranquil portraits of mothers and children. Morisot's works have been particularly popular in the United States, and many important works are in American collections. "

He was the most faithful pupil of Carlo Maratti, keeping his art alive into the 1720s with a softer, more elegant version of his classicism. This in its turn influenced the style of Agostino Masucci (1690-1768), Maratti's last significant pupil. According to Pascoli, Chiari was apprenticed to the painter and art dealer Carlantonio Galliani at the age of ten before he joined Maratti's studio in Rome, in 1666. His first official commission was for paintings on the side walls of the chapel of the Marcaccioni in Santa Maria del Suffragio, Rome (Birth of the Virgin; Adoration of the Magi), entrusted to him on the death of Niccolò Berrettoni (1637-1682), who had originally been asked to do them. This project established his reputation, and thereafter he won the patronage of many noble Roman families and of foreign visitors to Rome. He frescoed rooms in the Palazzo Barberini, Palazzo Colonna, and Palazzo Spada, and he also painted for several churches in Rome. He was a teacher of William Kent (1685-1748), Paolo Anesi (1697-1773), and Giovanni Andrea Lazzarini (1710-1801). He became director or principe of the Accademia di San Luca (1723-25). "

41763,Diana Scultori,1536,1590,"Italian engraver, also known as Diana Mantovana. She came from a family of artists, her father, Giovanni Battista Mantovano, was a sculptor and engraver, who worked with Giulio Romano at the Palazzo del Tè in Mantua. The surname Scultori was assumed for her during the nineteenth century by art historians. Originally scholars recorded her name as Diana Ghisi based upon a mistaken relationship to the engraver Giorgio Ghisi. Diana most often signed her own work ""Diana Mantuana"" or ""Diana Mantovana."" She began her training in the art of engraving from her father and the artist Giulio Romano, who worked with him. As an artist, Scultori engraved religious and mythological subjects; the inspiration for many tracing back to Romano. Scultori received her first public recognition as an engraver in Giorgio Vasari's second edition of Le Vite (1568). The biographer visited Mantua in 1566 and it is likely that her father arranged for the two to meet in order to advance her career. Scultori also met the architect, Francesco da Volterra (also known as Francesco Capriani) in 1565 when he moved to Mantua. The pair married soon thereafter and traveled to Rome by 1575. In Rome, Scultori quickly set about the business of advancing her husband's career as an architect. In 1575, the year of her first dated print, she received a Papal Privilege to make and market her own work. Privileges of this nature were rare, especially for women. Scultori's active period as an artist ends in 1588, the date of her last known print. However, it can be assumed that she continued to reproduce her own prints and it is known that they were reproduced after her death. In 1578, Scultori gave birth to a son, Giovanni Battista Capriani. Her husband died in 1594 and a few years later Scultori married another architect, Giulio Pelosi. "

In 1710, he settled in Regensburg (or Ratisbon as it was known that time), and found work as the assistant of an apothecary. By 1712 he had his own apothecary. He became a town councilor in 1722, a commercial assessor in 1725, and a city assessor in 1733.  His business interests flourished, allowing him the freedom to indulge in his pursuit of botany. He created a botanical garden in Regensburg. Weinmann's Phytanthoza iconographia is highly regarded for the quality of its colour plates, and the accuracy of its images compared with previous herbals. Weinmann was greatly respected for his writings on medicinal plants and herbs, and Phytanthoza iconographia is recognised as the first important botanical work to use colour engraved prints. "

After two years in Heidelberg, he was made a master in the Mechelen Guild of St Luke. After the annexation of the city by the Spanish troops in 1572, Bol settled in Antwerp, where he became a master in 1574. A decade later he left Antwerp, arriving in Amsterdam after travelling to Bergen-op-Zoom, Dordrecht and Delft. Van Mander's statement that he was buried in Amsterdam on 20 November 1593 is disputed by some sources because of a supposedly signed Adoration of the Shepherds dated 1595. Bol’s most important students included his stepson Frans Boels, Jacob Savery and Joris Hoefnagel."

36432,George Romney,1734,1802,"Fashionable portrait painter of late 18th-century English society. In his portraits Romney avoided any suggestion of the character or sensibilities of the sitter. His great success with his society patrons depended largely on just this ability for dispassionate flattery. Line rather than colour dominates; the flowing rhythms and easy poses of Roman classical sculpture underlie the smooth patterns of his compositions. From 1755 to 1757 Romney was the pupil of Christopher Steele, an itinerant portrait and genre painter. Romney's career began when he toured the northern English counties painting portraits for a few guineas each. In 1762 he went to London. His history painting The Death of General Wolfe won him an award from the Society of Arts; nonetheless he turned almost immediately to portrait painting. In 1764 he paid his first visit to Paris, where he was befriended by Joseph Vernet. Romney especially admired the work of Nicolas Le Sueur, whose use of the antique strongly appealed to him. In 1773 he went to Italy for two years, where he studied Raphael's Stanze frescoes in Rome, Titian's paintings in Venice, and Correggio's at Parma. Travel abroad matured his art, and a new gracefulness appears in portraits such as Mrs. Carwardine and Son (1775) and the conscious elegance of the large full-length Sir Christopher and Lady Sykes (1786). Romney was by nature sensitive and introspective. He held himself aloof from the Royal Academy and his fellow artists, making his friends in philosophical and literary circles. About 1781-82 he met Emma Hart (later Lady Hamilton), who exercised a morbid fascination over him. For Romney she became a means of escape into an imaginary, ideal world. His ""divine Emma"" appears in more than 50 paintings, in guises ranging from a bacchante to Joan of Arc. Almost all were painted from memory. "

63311,Nicholas of Verdun,,,"French goldsmith. His known works indicate that he was one of the leading metalworkers of his day and an early exponent of the classicising styles around 1200 that formed a transition between Romanesque and Gothic. In his two dated signatures, ""NICOLAUS VIRDUNENSIS (1181)"" on the enamel decoration of the former pulpit in Klosterneuburg Abbey, Austria, and ""MAGISTER NICHOLAUS DE VERDUM (1205)"" on the Shrine of the Virgin in Tournai Cathedral, the artist gave as his place of origin Verdun, in Lorraine, an area that in the 12th century had close economic and cultural links with the Rhineland, Champagne, the Ile-de-France and the metalworking centres of the Meuse. A more ambiguous signature, ""NICOLAUS DE VERDA"", was on the pedestal of one of a lost pair of enthroned, silver-gilt statuettes in Worms Cathedral representing St Peter and the founder Queen Constance, the wife either of Emperor Henry VI (m. 1186; d 1198) or of Emperor Frederick II (m. 1209; d 1222). The spelling Verda may perhaps be a defect or a copyist's error. The theory that Nicholas spent his last years as a citizen of Tournai, or had a son there of the same name, was based on mistaken evidence: the reference to a 'namesake' dates from 1318, not 1217, and concerns not a painter on glass (voirier) but a furrier (vairier). Master Nicholas of Verdun is known by his work, not his life. Neither date nor place of his birth have been established. The twelfth century was a time of general turmoil, power struggles, crusades, heresies, persecutions, famines, papal schisms, regicides, migrations and new threats from expansionist Islam. Little wonder Master Nicholas' birth records are lost. So is all other documentary evidence, e.g. guild membership, marriage license, etc. Tradition has it that Nicholas of Verdun learned his quadruple trade of goldsmith, enamel expert, painter and sculptor as an apprentice to one, or many, of the great artists who had followed Abbot Suger's call to restore and innovate the abbey of Saint-Denis. The great Master of Verdun's renditions of reality are in harmony with other representative masterpieces of the high Middle Ages. In 1181 he executed his masterpiece, the enamelled ambo, in the form of a triptych representing 51 biblical scene, for the commission of the Prior of the Abbey at Klosterneuburg, near Vienna in Austria. In 1184 he worked in Cologne and realized the Reliquary of the Three Magi for the Cathedral. In 1205 he executed the Reliquary of Our Lady, a sumptuous casket in silver and gilded copper for the Cathedral in Tournai. The high relief figures depict the life of Christ and the shrine is further adorned with magnificent medallions. "
35571,Hans Makart,1840,1884,"Austrian painter. He studied (1860-65) at the Akademie in Munich under the history painter Karl Theodor von Piloty whose influence is evident in Makart's Death of Pappenheim (1861; Vienna, Historisches Museum). Makart visited London and Paris in 1862 and Rome in 1863. The Papal Election (1863-65; Munich, Neue Pinakothek) reveals Makart's skill in the bold use of colour to convey drama as well as his virtuoso draughtsmanship. Two decorative triptychs, Modern Cupids (1868; Vienna, Zentsparkasse), and the Plague in Florence (1868; private collection), brought Makart both fame and disapproval (mostly because they lacked a literary original) when exhibited in Munich in 1868. His plan for the second work (c. 1868; St Gall, Kunstmuseum) shows a setting of sombre magnificence. In 1869, he was called to Vienna where he shaped Viennese aestheticism like no artist before or after him. The ""Makart style"" determined the culture of an entire era. Makart attracted the public through the sensuous appeal of his large-scale, theatrical productions of historicising  motifs painted in brilliant colours. He was deeply interested in the interaction of all the visual arts and thus the implementation of the idea of the ""total work of art"" which dominated discussions on the arts in the 19th century. This was the ideal which he realized in magnificent festivities which he organised. The culmination of these was the pageant of the City of Vienna organised to celebrate the silver wedding of the imperial couple in 1879. With his sketchy, fleeting mode of painting, Makart, whose artistic successor is said to be Gustav Klimt, exerted a seminal influence on the development of painting after 1900. "

He came from a family of Florentine weavers and may have been Raphael's pupil in Rome, since his brother had an important position in Raphael's Roman workshop. In the late 1520s, Penni worked with his brother-in-law Perino del Vaga in Genoa and Lucca. In 1530 Penni traveled to France, where he remained until his death. From 1537 to 1540, he collaborated with Rosso Fiorentino and Francesco Primaticcio at the château of Fontainebleau. He also worked outside the court as a painter, draftsman, and tapestry designer. Penni's drawings for the Story of Diana served as models for a set of tapestries produced for King Henry II. His documented works include portraits and religious subjects. Penni settled in Paris in 1550, and from 1553 he worked primarily as a designer of engravings for Étienne Delaune and others. Engravers in France, Italy, and Flanders widely reproduced his designs. "

The son of a small farmer from Calvados, he started his career as a dealer in wallpaper in Paris. In 1838 he went into partnership with Achille Collas (1795-1859), who had just invented a machine to create miniature bronze replicas of statues. Together they started a business selling miniatures of antique statues from museums all over Europe. From 1843 they extended their scope by reproducing the work of living artists and also diversified by making enamelled household objects. With the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian war in 1870 the firm briefly had to switch to cannon founding owing to the shortage of metals but resumed business afterwards. Following Barbedienne's death in 1892, the firm was carried on by his nephew Gustave Leblanc until 1952. Among the principal artists reproduced by the firm were Antoine Louis Barye and Auguste Rodin.

He is considered the most important architect of the late eighteenth century in England. Together with his brother James (1730-1794), he transformed Palladian Neoclassicism in England into the airy, light, elegant style that bears their name (Adam style). His major architectural works include public buildings (especially in London), and his designs were used for the interiors of such country mansions as Syon House in Middlesex (now in Hounslow, London). He spent a fairly long period in Rome between 1754-58 where he came to know the famous architectural theoretician and engraver Giovanni Battista Piranesi and the French draftsman Charles-Louis Clérisseau. In 1755 Robert Adam began a long association with Charles-Louis Clérisseau, first as his student later as his employer. Clérisseau assisted Adam in his study of ancient architectural and decorative forms and their adaptation to a new architectural style. Adam also led an expedition to Dalmatia in order to record the precise measurements of Diocletian's palace at Spalato (now Split). The results of this were published in 1764 under the title The Ruins of Spalato. He settled in London at the end of the 1750s. After his return to England, Adam was mainly involved in the decoration of existing interiors. Syon House, Middlesex gives some idea of the way in which he was able to interpret and enhance motifs from a wide variety of classical sources. "

He was part of a Flemish family of artists, son of a Leuven blacksmith, Joost Massys (d. 1483), and his wife, Katharina van Kinckem. Joost Massys is known to have executed commissions for the new Leuven Stadhuis (1448–63), one of the most ornate town halls in the Netherlands, as well as other work for the Leuven authorities, and to have been superintendent of the chapel belonging to the Leuven metalsmiths’ Guild of St Eligius. About 1492 Quentin married Alyt van Tuylt (d. 1507), by whom he had three children: Quinten, Pawel and Katelijne. He was by then already living in Antwerp and was admitted into the painters' guild. In 1508 he married Catherina Heyns, with whom he had ten more children: Jan Massys and Cornelis Massys, as well as Quinten II, Maria, Hubrecht, Abraham, Peternella, Katelijne II, Sara and Susannah. Both Jan and Cornelis became artists but were still under the age of majority at the time of their father’s death, of the 'sweating sickness' (plague). Among Massys' early works are two pictures of the Virgin and Child. His most celebrated paintings are two large triptych altarpieces, The Holy Kinship, (or St Anne Altarpiece) ordered for the St Pieterskerk in Leuven (1507-09), and The Entombment of the Lord (c. 1508-11), both of which exhibit strong religious feeling and precision of detail. His tendency to accentuate individual expression is demonstrated in such pictures as The Old Man and the Courtesan and The Moneylender and His Wife. Christus Salvator Mundi and The Virgin in Prayer display serene dignity. Pictures with figures on a smaller scale are a polyptych, the scattered parts of which have been reassembled, and a later Virgin and Child. His landscape backgrounds are in the style of one of his contemporaries, the Flemish artist Joachim Patenier; the landscape depicted in Massys' The Crucifixion is believed to be the work of Patinier. Massys painted many notable portraits, including one of his friend Erasmus. Although his portraiture is more subjective and personal than that of Albrecht Dürer or Hans Holbein, Massys' painting may have been influenced by both German masters. Massys' lost St Jerome in His Study, of which a copy survives in Vienna, is indebted to Dürer's St Jerome, now in Lisbon. Some Italian influence may also be detected, as in Virgin and Child (Nationalmuseum, Poznan, Poland), in which the figures are obviously copied from Leonardo da Vinci's Virgin of the Rocks (Louvre, Paris).

36424,Christian Rohlfs,1849,1938,"German painter and printmaker. He studied painting at the Kunstschule in Weimar (1870). Prolonged illness forced him to interrupt his studies, which he resumed in 1874 under Ferdinand Schauss (1832-1916) and Alexandre Struys (1852-1941). Through visits to Paris in the 1870s, he came into contact with the art of the Barbizon school, painting ""en plein-air"" on his return to Weimar. Under the influence of Struys he painted figurative works, such as Roman Builders (1879; Westfälisches Landesmuseum, Münster), and nudes in the tradition of academically enlightened Realism. In 1881 Rohlfs worked in a studio under Max Thedy (1858-1924). From c. 1883 he painted mainly landscapes with the approval of Ludwig von Gleichen-Russwurm (1836-1901), who was studying with Theodor Hagen (1842-1919), and was influenced in an indirect way by Albert Brendel (1827-1895), who had taught at Weimar from 1875. He often chose formats that were unusually large for landscape paintings in this period, presenting landscape in a similar way to history painting. Atmosphere and light played an important role even in these early pictures. From 1884 he worked as an independent painter. After 1885 colour became increasingly important for its own sake; light and shade were suggested purely by colour, which was applied in impasto spots and brushstrokes to create chiaroscuro values that determined the form, for example Wild Garden near Weimar (1888; Weimar, Schlossmuseum). By the end of the 1880s he had developed an independent style parallel to Impressionist painting. When he saw works by Monet exhibited in Weimar in 1897, these corroborated his own efforts. From 1895 Rohlfs stayed in Berlin; from1900 he was member of the Berlin Secession. In 1905-06 he painted in the summer months at Soest and met Nolde. From 1910 he turned to Expressionism; in 1911 he joined the New Secession and in 1914 the Free Secession. In 1914 he became a member of the Prussian Academy of Arts in Berlin, but in 1937 all his works were confiscated by the Nazis as degenerate art, he was dismissed from the Berlin Academy and forbidden to paint.

34049,Gustave Courbet,1819,1877,"French painter, born at Ornans, near the Swiss border of France. He was in Paris by 1839, working under a minor painter, in the so-called Ateliers Libres and in the Louvre, copying Dutch, Flemish, Venetian and Spanish pictures, as well as works by Delacroix and Géricault. Much later - characteristically - he claimed to have been self-taught. He exhibited at the Salon regularly only after the State bought his After Dinner at Ornans (1849, Lille), when the award of a medal exempted him from the jury system, until the privilege was abolished in 1857. He often exhibited in the provinces, which were generally less acidly critical than Paris, and he made many trips to Belgium, Holland and Germany between 1846 and 1868, exhibiting there with more success than in France. He evolved a vigorous naturalism, tinged with the influence of Caravaggio and the Venetians, and painted scenes of everyday life, portraits (particularly self-portraits), nudes, still-life, sea- and landscapes, and flowers. The landscapes are often of mountain scenery round Ornans, and include hunting scenes or deer in the snow. His scenes from everyday life range from the depiction of abject poverty (as in the Stonebreakers), social comment (the Young Women of the Village or the Young Women by the Seine) to the representation of a peasant funeral with more than fifty life-size figures in the Burial at Ornans. He also painted a quasi-philosophical manifesto in the huge Painter in his Studio. In 1853, Alfred Bruyas, a rich collector, bought the Bathers and the Spinner and sat for his portrait. Their unlikely friendship endured until Courbet's death, and Bruyas was his most devoted patron, host and admirer, portrayed in the Bonjour, Monsieur Courbet of 1854. All the Bruyas pictures are now in Montpellier, Musée Fabre. In 1855 and 1867, on the occasion of International Exhibitions in Paris, he held large private exhibitions of his works in an attempt to offset official neglect. Both attracted more adverse than helpful comment, but they established the precedent of private exhibitions, later followed by Manet and the Impressionists. Courbet was intransigent in his political attitudes, articulately Republican and anti-Imperialist, a friend of the socialist philosopher Prudhon, and rabidly anticlerical. His Return from the Conference (1862), depicting drunken priests, was rejected both by the official Salon and the Salon des Refusés, earned him general abuse, and was bought by a strict Catholic who destroyed it. After the restoration of Republican government, following the disasters of the Franco-Prussian War, he proposed the demolition of the Vendome Column, which celebrated the victories of the first Napoleon, although he does not appear to have had a hand in the actual demolition in April 1871. At the overthrow of the Commune he was arrested and sentenced to 6 months' imprisonment for his part in the destruction of the column; but in 1873 he was re-tried and condemned to pay for its restoration, estimated at over Fr.323,000. Faced with total ruin, he fled to Switzerland. He set up a picture factory, employing hacks in what was virtually a production-line for Swiss landscapes, which have damaged his reputation. His technique was imperfect; reworkings and bitumen have played havoc with many works, and his brushwork and use of the trowel-shaped palette knife are often as insensitive as his colour, although in his best works this can be extraordinarily rich, his chiaroscuro and his vivid, unconventional approach dramatically exciting. Many of his nudes range from the mildly to the highly erotic, but his painting of bare flesh is always superb. He had a certain influence on Whistler, although the American indignantly repudiated this. He was of inordinate vanity, with an unendearingly caustic tongue, and led a flamboyantly Bohemian life; eventually he developed dropsy and died in exile on the last day of 1877. "

41667,Martino Altomonte,1657,1745,"Martino Altomonte (Johann Martin Hohenberg), Austrian painer, part of a family of artists. He was apprenticed at the age of 15 to Baciccio (Giovanni Battista Gaulli) in Rome, where he next studied with Carlo Maratti. In 1684 he was offered an appointment at the court of King John III of Poland and altered his name to Martino Altomonte. He travelled to Warsaw, where he produced paintings of royal battles and portraits (untraced) for the royal castle of Zólkiew (now Nesterov) near Lwow (now Lviv, Ukraine). It appears that he also painted a fair number of altarpieces. Of these, only the Sacrifice of Abraham (now Tarnów, Diocese Museum) survives, a work that reveals Altomonte as a follower of Neapolitan chiaroscuro painting. Between 1699 and 1702 Altomonte moved to Vienna, where he became a teaching member of the Akademie der Bildenden Künste in 1707. It was probably in connection with his admission to the Akademie that he was commissioned to decorate the Neue Favorita, an annexe of Schloss Augarten. The few surviving oil paintings from this period, for example Susanna and the Elders (1709; Vienna, Belvedere), show the strong impact of the Neapolitan painting of Luca Giordano and suggest Venetian influence as well. Altomonte developed a mixed Neapolitan-Venetian style that incorporated the illusionistic architecture of Andrea Pozzo and created a style that set the standard for Viennese Baroque painting. In his oil paintings he scattered Venetian pastel tones among dramatic elements of Neapolitan chiaroscuro. In 1709-10 he worked on ceiling paintings for the archbishop's Residenz at Salzburg, and about 1710 he became imperial court painter. He also produced altar paintings in Vienna for the Dorotheerkirche (1713; now in Rheindorfer Parish Church), the Peterskirche and the Stephansdom (both 1714) and for the parish church in Krems and the Deutschordenskirche in Laibach (now Ljubljana, Slovenia; both 1715). In 1716 he painted the ceiling frescoes in the Lower Belvedere in Vienna. "
40975,William Holman Hunt,1827,1910,"English painter, co-founder of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood. A clerk for several years, he left the world of trade to study at the British Museum and the National Gallery. In 1844 he entered the Royal Academy. Here he joined with Millais and Rossetti to develop the Pre-Raphaelite theories of art and, in 1848, to found the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood. His first canvas to interpret these themes was Rienzi, exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1849. In 1854 Hunt went to the Holy Land to portray scenes from the life of Christ, aiming to achieve total historical and archaeological truth. He returned to Palestine in 1869 and again in 1873. Throughout his life Hunt remained dedicated to Pre-Raphaelite concepts, as exemplified in such works as The Light of the World, The Scapegoat and The Shadow of Death. "

41237,Pieter van Bloemen,1657,1720,"Flemish painter, member of a Flamish family of painters and draughtsmen, active also in Italy and France, brother of Jan Frans van Bloemen. While still in their native Antwerp, Pieter was the first teacher of his brother Jan Frans - who later also studied with Antoine Goubau - and probably also of his younger brother Norbert (1670-c. 1746). From 1667 Pieter had himself trained with Simon van Douw (c. 1630-c. 1677), and in 1673 he became a master in the Antwerp Guild of St Luke. The following year he travelled to Rome. He is recorded in Lyon about a decade later (c. 1684) in the company of the Dutch artists Adriaen van der Cabel and Gillis Weenix. At about the same time (c. 1684-85) Jan Frans was in Paris, until he was summoned by his brother to Lyon. The two brothers were not happy in Lyon, however, and went to Rome. They travelled via Turin, staying there for some time. From 1686-87 they were in Rome, where they were both members of the Schildersbent, the confraternity of Dutch and Flemish artists active in Rome. Pieter was given the bent or nickname Standaart (or Stendardo), undoubtedly a reference to the banners and standards that he depicted in his scenes of soldiers; Jan Frans's facility for producing panoramic landscapes earned him the nickname Orizzonte (It.: 'horizon'), which had previously been applied to Claude Lorrain. Pieter left Rome in 1692, after having had the Flemish painter Frans Vanier as his assistant (1689-92); he was back in Antwerp in 1694 and became dean of the Guild of St Luke there in 1699. Pieter's production of paintings was prolific; most are landscapes with figures and animals, caravan scenes with camps and resting travellers and animals, military and genre scenes and horse markets. He was at his best painting animals, which he also provided for works by other artists. His period in Italy was the most successful of his career, and his work continued to bear traces of its influence to the end of his life. Characteristic of van Bloemen's style are carefully grouped 'still-lifes' of animals, open, Italianate landscapes with one or two monuments to convey the 'Roman' atmosphere and the lively colouring of the figures' costumes contrasted to the more sombre greys and browns of the herds and ruins. Typical works include a Herd of Cattle in the Ruins of the Roman Forum (Karlsruhe, Staatliche Kunsthalle); a Blacksmith with a pendant Drinking-place (both in private collections); Riders in a Roman Landscape (1700; Dresden, Gemäldegalerie); a Caravan (1704; Madrid, Prado); a Cavalry Camp (1708; Rome, Palazzo Barberini); and the Market between Roman Ruins (1710; Dresden, Gemaldegalerie). His drawings are mainly landscapes and figure and animal studies from life. "

48153,Franz Ludwig Catel,1778,1856,"German painter. As a child, Catel helped carve small wooden figures in the toyshop owned by his father. With the encouragement of the printmaker Daniel Chodowiecki, Catel enrolled at the Berlin Kunstakademie, becoming a full member in 1806. In 1807, after already making a name for himself as a watercolourist and book illustrator, he began several years of study at the Académie des Beaux-Arts in Paris, where his main subject was oil painting. In 1811 he moved to Italy, where he stayed for the rest of his life. Initially he wavered between Joseph Anton Koch's classically heroic style of landscape painting and the Romantic lyricism of the Nazarenes. Eventually he found that he could best exercise his technical ability, and most quickly achieve fame and fortune, by producing Italian landscapes. He specialized in Neapolitan scenes depicting festive folk customs; and such paintings proved popular with the mass of wealthy travellers who came to Italy after the Napoleonic Wars. "

In early 15th-century Florence, Apollonio was a leading supplier of cassoni. His workshop was the most fashionable firm in the city: in the 17 recorded years of its existence, the artist and his craftsmen produced more than 300 cassoni. In his works, obvious affinity can be seen with Florentine painters of his time: Fra Angelico, Domenico Veneziano, Paolo Uccello, Benozzo Gozzoli. Apollonio worked in collaboration with Marco del Buono Giamberti (1402-1489) until 1463. "

40518,Nicholas Pocock,1740,1821,"English painter and sailor. After an apprenticeship in the Bristol shipbuilding yards of Richard Champion, Pocock began a career at sea in the mid-1760s. He was a practiced and gifted amateur watercolourist (his earliest signed and dated watercolour is from 1762), and when in command of the Lloyd, one of Champion's merchantmen, he began to keep detailed logbooks illustrated with wash drawings (four at London, National Maritime Museum). In 1780 he gave up his sea career, married and sent his first oil painting to the Royal Academy. The picture arrived too late for exhibition, but Sir Joshua Reynolds wrote back, noting 'It is much beyond what I expected from a first essay in oil colours'. Pocock exhibited annually at the Academy between 1782 and 1812 and enjoyed a steady supply of commissions for oil paintings and watercolours, mostly of marine subject-matter. He produced a series of watercolour views of Bristol in the 1780s, many of which were engraved, and of Iceland in 1791. In 1804 and 1811, editions of William Falconer's poem The Shipwreck were published with plates etched after Pocock's designs. Pocock worked as a war artist in the 1790s: he witnessed the Battle of the Glorious First of June (1794) and recorded this and several other actions of the French wars; many of these works were engraved. Less adept artistically than his predecessor Charles Brooking and less advantaged socially than his contemporaries the Serres family, Pocock was nevertheless a gifted and prolific artist. Works such as the Cutting out of the 'Hermione' (1800; London, National Maritime Museum), romantic in spirit, confirm his artistic range. One of his sons, William Innes Pocock (1783-1836), also became a seaman and marine artist. "

He returned to London in 1765 and stayed until 1771, being elected a Founder-Member of the Royal Academy in 1768. His light and facile style of landscape painting, with picturesque peasantry, was very popular in England and was preferred to the graver style of Wilson. There are several examples in the Royal Collection, Windsor, and others in Cambridge (Fitzwilliam Museum), Glasgow, London (National Gallery), Manchester, Oxford , Venice and elsewhere. London (Tate Gallery) has his grand historical landscape, Cadmus Killing the Dragon (1765). "

37130,Giorgio Vasari,1511,1574,"Italian painter, architect and biographer, one of Italy's busiest and most influential Mannerist artists. Born in the Florentine subject city of Arezzo, Giorgio was the child of a potter, and precocious enough for Cardinal Silvio Passerini, guardian of the young Ippolito and Alessandro de' Medici, to sponsor his education alongside them in Florence - presumably to act as a provincial spur to their overprivileged laggardliness. Thus began a connection with the Medici that lasted until the death of the steadiest patron of his work as a painter, architect and decorator-of-all-work, the Grand Duke Cosimo I. Thanks to a steady succession of Medicean and papal commissions (interspersed with others from individuals and religious bodies), Vasari produced an immense volume of artistic work, helped by a natural fluency and by teams of capable assistants: both were factors in his contemporary fame as an artist and his subsequent neglect - until quite recently. He was trained in Florence, in the circle of Andrea del Sarto and his pupils Rosso and Pontormo, where, above all, he became a Michelangelo idolater. As a painter his quality can be gauged by the posthumous portrait of Lorenzo the Magnificent, the altarpiece of the Immaculate Conception in SS. Apostoli, the decorative schemes in the Salone dei Cinquecento and elsewhere in the Palazzo Vecchio - all in Florence; and by the Sala dei Cento Giorni (Room of the Hundred Days - the time he took to paint it) and the Sala Regia in Rome: in the Palazzo della Cancelleria and the Vatican respectively. Some of his principal paintings are in his own house in Arezzo, which is now a museum. He was important in the development of Counter-Reformation iconography, as in his Immaculate Conception (Florence, SS. Apostoli; sketch in Oxford, Ashmolean), and in elaborate allegories glorifying the Medici Grand Dukes. As an architect he can be judged from the Florentine Uffizi and the Pisan Palazzo dei Cavalieri. In spite of almost incessant artistic activity he found time to establish a more lasting and far more respected reputation as a writer. In his Le Vite de' più eccelenti architetti, pittori, et scultori italiani (Lives of the most excellent painters, sculptors and architects), planned from 1543, published in 1550 and heavily revised in 1568, he wrote the first and still the most influential of all narrative and critical histories of art. The Vite drew on the same philosophical, shaping drive as distinguished the work of the great political historians of his youth, Machiavelli and Guicciardini. They embody the humanist notion that history should instruct and encourage through the record of notable careers and notable achievements: and he humanizes their humanism by infusing the biographies with the spirit of Boccaccio's novellas. Though substituting the pen for the brush, he never pretends not to be a professional artist; the Lives are introduced by a long technical preface on materials and procedures, and they reflect his determination to give his profession a pedigree that would enhance public respect for its practitioners. No other work of the period contains so many independent judgments. Of the facts (gleaned from tours of Italy, correspondence, reading and the questioning of artists or their surviving friends), enough are accurate to ensure the status of the Lives as the quarry from which all histories of Italian Renaissance art must be hewn. The judgments were based on the first developed vocabulary of critical appraisal, with such concepts as proportion, design and manner being used as a check on the success with which an artist brought his first idea to completion. His book became the model for artistic biographers in other countries, such as van Mander in the Netherlands, Palomino in Spain, and Sandrart in Germany. Equally revolutionary was his notion of progress in the arts. He did not attempt to press sculpture and architecture into the same pattern, but allowed for their shifting position within a route which painting had followed. When ancient Rome fell, art declined. All the Italians knew of art was the flat, lifeless style derived from Byzantium. Then, around 1250, art was reborn. It grew to maturity in 3 stages. In the first (whose hero was Giotto), artists began to grope towards imitating the colours and forms of nature, the solid physical presence and the expressiveness of the living human body. In the second (whose inspiration was Masaccio), from c. 1400 to c. 1500, they indulged in a riot of experiment, especially in perspective and anatomy, that brought art's ability to record the real ""world almost to fruition, though it retained a certain harsh or rule-fettered flavour. It was in the third period, which included the careers of Leonardo, Raphael and Michelangelo, that artists not only mastered nature but triumphed over her. And when the grace and omnicompetence of a painter's hand could go, as Vasari put it, 'beyond the hand of nature', then the art of antiquity had been surpassed and the rebirth of art had led to a career for it of unparalleled achievement. Vasari's concept of Renaissance invoked a period from the early 14 century to the 1560s when, with Michelangelo dead (in 1564), Vasari himself was left - as he fairly directly implies - to keep the momentum going on his own. It is far from a coincidence that most subsequent views of 'Renaissance' envisage the same timescale. He saw his 3 phases anthropomorphically, as representing the childhood, youth and maturity of art; the imprint of this implied critical canon has faded, but it determined the value placed upon works of art for centuries.

36408,David Roberts,1796,1864,"Scottish painter. He was apprenticed to a house painter, then worked as a scene painter for a travelling circus and Glasgow and Edinburgh theatres, in 1822 he settled in London and worked at the Drury Lane Theatre with his friend Clarkson Stanfield. From 1831 he travelled widely in Europe and the Mediterranean basin and made a fortune with his topographical views. He worked in oil and watercolour and published lavishly illustrated books, among them the six-volume The Holy Land, Syria, Idumea, Arabia, Egypt & Nubia (1842-49). His work can be monotonous when seen en masse, but at his best he combines bold design with precise observation. "

41535,William Anderson,1757,1837,"Scottish painter. He was born in Scotland in 1757, though the precise details of date and place are elusive. He trained initially as a shipwright, but by the age of thirty was an accomplished and skilled marine painter and had settled in London. He seems to have applied himself to the study of the Dutch Old Masters of the Van de Velde school, since he produced numerous small works on panel which are strongly evocative of that style. Anderson first exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1787. He seems to have been on the periphery of artistic life in London: he was a pall-bearer at the funeral of Giuseppe Marchi, Reynolds's favourite assistant, and in 1797 he was an unsuccessful candidate for Associate Membership of the Royal Academy. He seems to have had no part in the artistic controversies of the day. His regular Royal Academy exhibitions continued annually until 1811, and then intermittently until his last in 1834. His best work was executed in the years 1790-1810, when the demand for marine paintings, during the Napoleonic Wars, was at an all-time high. Anderson painted many of the naval battles of the period, often commissioned by serving officers, and his work shows a meticulous attention to nautical detail allied to an accurate draughtsmanship and lively colouration. At this period, he may be considered one of the leading marine artists of his generation. Anderson and his wife Sarah were great friends of the landscape painter Julius Caesar Ibbetson who had also been trained as a shipwright. Towards the end of his career, Ibbetson moved to Yorkshire, and it seems likely that Anderson visited him there. Certainly, Anderson was a considerable influence on the development of marine painting in the port of Hull, where a lively school developed in the early years of the 19th century, most notably in his encouragement of the best painter of that school John Ward (1798-1849).

7353,Thomas Eakins,1844,1916,"American painter, photographer, and sculptor, best known for his precise, exacting paintings in the tradition of the Barbizon School and Velázquez. He studied with Gérome and others in Paris from 1866-1869, but returned to Philadelphia in 1870 where he painted local figures and scenes that emphasized emotional truth and visual fact. He visited Spain, where he was drawn to the works of Velázquez. His interest in science led to probably his best-known painting, The Gross Clinic (1875), showing the famous surgeon in the operating theater. The picture shocked contemporaries with its frank depiction of blood. Eakins taught at the Philadelphia Academy of the Arts from 1876-1878, reforming the teaching methods and giving priority to painting from live nude models as oppose to drawing from plaster casts. He was forced to resign in 1886 for working with nude models in mixed classes. In addition to numerous portraits, he painted boating and other outdoor scenes that reflect his fascination with the human body in motion. Eakins was one of the first American photographers to explore the nude, in anatomy and motion studies and artistic studies of the human form. The latter often reflected a latent sexuality, which, along with his reliance on nude models in teaching, precipitated the scandals that plagued his life. Although he never achieved commercial success during his lifetime because of his realism and his resistance to prevailing genteel cosmopolitanism, Thomas Eakins was arguably the finest nineteenth-century American painter.

8767,Christophe Fratin,1800,1864,"French sculptor, the son of a taxidermist. He first studied sculpture under Charles Augustin Pioche (1762-1839) in Metz but became disillusioned with the romantic style of the day and moved to Paris where he studied under the painter and sculptor Géricault. Fratin was one of the first of the French sculptors, along with Antoine Louis Barye, to successfully portray animals in bronze. His understanding of animal anatomy as well as their natural actions and poses gives his bronzes a life like realism. Most of his animal subjects appear gaunt with pronounced rib cages which is what they would have look like in their natural environment as opposed to the well fed zoo animals that were modeled by so many artists. Fratin's true understanding of animal anatomy and form came from his early experiences helping his father with his taxidermy business. Fratin's animal bronzes were very popular in most European countries as well as America and England during his lifetime. Some of his most favoured and collected sculptures are his numerous dancing bears, and dressed animals which are engaged in human activities. Fratin's work was highly romantic in its interpretation without the dramatic and sometimes violent treatment that Barye so successfully portrayed. Fratin executed may wild and domestic animal groups always capturing his subjects in their normal activities such as eating or in flight or motion with their flowing manes and tails. His ability to capture an animal in full flight, or at the exact moment of it's being caught by a predator was unmatched by any artist before or since his time. Fratin received several monumental commissions in France as well as other countries, one of which was the Deux Aigles Gardant Leur Proie which is located in New York's Central Park. Fratin exhibited at the Paris Salon in the years 1831-1842 and 1850-1862. He also exhibited at the Great Exhibition in London in 1851. "

35623,John Martin,1789,1854,"English Romantic painter and mezzotint engraver, celebrated for his melodramatic scenes of cataclysmic events crowded with tiny figures placed in vast architectural settings. He caught the public imagination with spectacular paintings such as Joshua Commanding the Sun to Stand Still (United Grand Lodge of Great Britain, London, 1816), the work that made him famous, and in 1821 Lawrence referred to him as 'the most popular painter of the day'. His work was indeed truly popular, for he made his living mainly through the sale of engravings of his pictures rather than the paintings themselves. He became famous in France as well as Britain, he was knighted by Leopold I of Belgium (1833), and his influence was felt by American artists such as Cole. However, while he pleased a vast audience and was regarded by some admirers as one of the greatest geniuses who ever lived, Martin was reviled by Ruskin and other critics, who considered his work vulgar sensationalism. Few artists, indeed, have been subject to such extremes of critical fortune, and his fame sank to such an astonishing degree after his death that very large and once famous paintings by him were sold in the 1930s for as little as £ 2. In the 1970s his reputation greatly revived. Martin made mezzotints not only as a means of reproducing his paintings but also as original compositions. Particularly noteworthy are his illustrations to the Bible and John Milton's Paradise Lost, which show that although he had great weaknesses as an artist, especially in his drawing of the human figure, he also had a vividness and grandiloquence of imagination not unworthy of such elevated subjects. He is sometimes called 'Mad Martin', but the sobriquet is undeserved and applies more to his brother Jonathan, who was insane and set fire to York Minster. John Martin was eminently sane and in the 1830s almost bankrupted himself with extremely ambitious but entirely practical plans for improving the water supply and sewage system of London. They were unsuccessful, but reveal a heroic desire to put the architectural visions of his paintings into a concrete form. His work is best represented in the Tate Gallery, London, and the Laing Art Gallery, Newcastle upon Tyne. "

35766,Georges Michel,1763,1843,"French painter. He came from a humble background, his father being an employee at the market of Les Halles in Paris. At an early age, a farmer general, M. de Chalue, took an interest in him and found him a place with the curate of Veruts, on the plain of Saint-Denis, north of Paris. It was here that he first developed a love of the countryside. In 1775 he was apprenticed to a mediocre history painter called Leduc, but he preferred to go off and sketch out of doors. In order to assist him, M. de Berchigny, Colonel in the Hussars, engaged him in his regiment garrisoned in Normandy and arranged for him to take lessons in art. He remained there for more than a year and then returned to Paris, where he worked with M. de Grammont-Voulgy, who was Steward to the brother of Louis XVI. In 1789 Grammont-Voulgy took him to Switzerland, and Michel also visited Germany, where he stayed with the Duc de Guiche. He rarely exhibited at the Salons. After the revolution in 1830 he retired and devoted himself to drawing landscapes of the environment of Paris. In 1841 he sold his atelier, and his  almost thousand paintings on paper and about 2.000 drawings. He can be considered one of the forerunners of the painters of Barbizon. "

40666,Jean-Laurent Legeay,1705,1791,"French architect and draughtsman. He studied at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts, Paris, and won the Prix de Rome in 1732. His residence in Rome (1737-42) coincided with the arrival from Venice (1740) of Giovanni Battista Piranesi, who was considerably influenced by Legeay's dramatic engravings of the monuments of Roman antiquity. Legeay worked with Piranesi and other engravers on illustrations for guide books on Rome, and he was an important figure in the cross-currents of influence and ideas between Piranesi and the French scholars in Rome. Legeay returned to Paris in 1742, and he was appointed professor at the Académie Royale d'Architecture, where his drawing methods and his teaching were enormously influential on such pupils as Charles de Wailly and Étienne-Louis Boullée. In 1745 Legeay went to Berlin, where he worked on plans for the Catholic church of St Hedwig, a circular design derived from the Pantheon in Rome, which was illustrated in six engravings published in 1747. The building was completed to a modified design in 1773, finally receiving the lantern and cross that he had intended in 1886-87. Legeay obtained appointments at the court of Mecklenburg-Schwerin from 1748 to the mid-1750s; he laid out the Schlossgarten at Schwerin in the style of André Le Nôtre in the early 1750s and designed the Saalanbau of the palace at Rostock. In 1756 he went to Potsdam, where he worked for Frederick II, King of Prussia, on the Neues Palais at Sanssouci, together with Johann Gottfried Buring, Karl Philipp Christian von Gontard (1731-1791) and Heinrich Ludwig Manger (1728-89). His individual contribution is difficult to determine, and he fell out with the king and left in 1763 when construction work began. He is certainly responsible, however, for the Communs in Potsdam, a pair of Neo-classical palaces - the first in this style in Prussia - built to accommodate courtiers. These buildings face the Neues Palais across a broad square; they are fronted by imposing double-curved staircases and linked by a semicircular colonnade designed by von Gontard. Legeay then travelled to England, where his presence is noted in 1766 and 1767. He was in contact with William Chambers, and he made a perspective drawing of Chambers's Casino at Marino, Dublin. He returned to France c. 1767 and worked on the publication of his various collections of engravings, including Fontane (1767), Rovine (1768), Vasi and Tombeaux (both published in Paris, 1770), all in the heavily monumental style that had so impressed Piranesi. Legeay is last recorded seeking a pension from the Duke of Mecklenburg in 1786 to enable him to spend his old age in Rome. His reputation is derived less from built works than from his drawings and projects, which inspired his French contemporaries in Rome (including Robert Le Lorrain, Nicolas-Marie Potain and Jacques-Edmé Dumont) as well as his pupils at the Académie Royale with an enthusiasm for Neo-classical forms and ambitious scale that spelt the end of the Rococo and anticipated the era of French Revolutionary architecture.

34248,Arthur Devis,1708,1787,"English painter, part of a family of painters. By 1728 he had left Preston, and the following year he was working in London for the Flemish topographical and sporting painter Peter Tillemans. There he specialized in landscape painting and copying various works in Tillemans's studio after Marco Ricci, Giovanni Paolo Pannini and Jan van Bloemen. Devis's earliest known commission, Hoghton Towers from Duxon Hill, Lancashire (1735; private collection), painted for Sir Henry Hoghton during a trip to Preston in 1734-35, shows Tillemans's influence in its attention to detail and the use of thin, transparent paint. Thomas Lister with his Family (c. 1738; Art Institute, Chicago) demonstrates a similar interest in landscape, featuring the family group in Gisburn Park, Lancs. Devis had returned to London by 1742 and established himself as a painter of conversation pieces, with a studio in Great Queen Street. He received his greatest number of commissions for portraits between 1748 and 1758. Many of the pictures show the sitters in landscapes. Although described with what seems like precise topographical detail, these views, like all but one of the interiors, were mostly invented by Devis. During the 1760s, Devis's success as a portrait painter diminished sharply. Although he exhibited works at the new Free Society of Artists between 1761 and 1775 and in 1780, becoming its president in 1768, his style seemed old-fashioned compared to portraits by important contemporary artists such as Joshua Reynolds and Johann Zoffany. During the 1770s and 1780s, he seems to have made his living by restoring pictures. He retired to Brighton in 1783 and died there in 1787. Devis married Elizabeth Faulkner (1719-1788) in 1742. They had twenty-two children, only six of whom survived past infancy. Two, Thomas Anthony Devis and Arthur William Devis, became painters. Devis's half-brother Anthony Devis also was a painter. "

Vasari, in his Vita of Marcantonio Raimondi, mentions that 'after the death of Rosso [Fiorentino], we saw the arrival from France of all the engravings of his works'. He attributed this upsurge of engraved reproductions 'to the copperplate engraver René', that is René Boyvin. He came to Paris c. 1545 from Angers, where he was an associate of the mint. In Paris he may have been in contact with Antonio Fantuzzi, and he is known to have renewed a contract of service with the engraver Pierre Milan in 1549. In 1553 he completed two plates that Milan had failed to finish for the music publisher Guillaume Morlaye (c. 1510-after 1558); one of these was the Nymph of Fontainebleau. He later opened his own workshop, and it is known that Lorenzo Penni, the son of Luca, was working for him in October 1557. Boyvin survived for many years despite the Calvinist beliefs for which he was imprisoned in January 1569. He seems to have published nothing under his own name between 1569 and 1574. His last dated work is from 1580, but it appears that he was still alive well into the 17th century. "

115906,Jakob Elsner,1460,1517,"German painter and illuminator. He began his training in the Upper Rhine, near Konstanz, and settled in Nuremberg, apparently establishing his reputation as a portrait painter by 1490. Several portraits have been attributed to him. In each of these rather broadly painted portraits the physiognomy is boldly articulated. There is an application of unblended highlights near the eye at the left, and the tip of the nose, and outlining the lips. The eyes are prominent, wide lower lips, the chin is modeled with broad strokes of light and dark paint, and the neck shows strong tonal contrasts. Jakob Elsner seems to have been one of the most important and successful predecessors of Dürer in the portrait genre. "

15450,Andrea Locatelli,1695,1741,"Italian painter. He received his first artistic training from his father, Giovanni Francesco Locatelli (c. 1660-1741), a little-known painter who settled in the district of Trastevere in Rome c. 1699. He then studied with Monsu Alto (d c. 1712), a painter of coastal views, few of whose works are known. After Alto's death he moved to the studio of Bernardino Fergioni (1674-c. 1738) and, lastly, to that of Biagio Puccini. His study of the human figure in the latter's studio laid the foundations of his later success as a painter of bambocciate. In 1715 he was commissioned to decorate a room in the Palazzo Ruspoli in Rome with marine scenes in gouache; he apparently painted only the figures himself and was already being paid at the rate customary for a master painter. He also decorated Prince Antonio Ottoboni's apartments in the Palazzo della Cancelleria, Rome, with landscapes (untraced), which were highly praised by Pio (1724). His most distinguished commissions were from Filippo Juvarra on behalf of Victor-Amadeus II of Savoy for two views of the unfinished castello of Rivoli in Turin, in which Locatelli interpreted Juvarra's plans and designs (1723-25; Racconigi, Castello). In 1735, again through Juvarra, he received a commission from King Philip V of Spain for two overdoors for La Granja, which show Christ in the Desert and Christ and the Woman of Samaria (both in situ). In 1738 he decorated two doors in the Palazzo Corsini, Rome (both in situ), each with four decorative panels of landscapes. "

40735,Parmigianino,1503,1540," Italian Mannerist painter and etcher (real name: Girolamo Francesco Mazzola), born in Parma, from which he takes his nickname. He was a precocious artist, and as early as 1522-23 painted accomplished frescoes in two chapels in S. Giovanni Evangelista, Parma, showing his admiration for Correggio, who had worked in the same church a year or two before. The originality and sophistication he displayed from the beginning, particularly his love of unusual spatial effects, is, however, most memorably seen in his Self-Portrait in a Convex Mirror (1524, Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna), in which Vasari said he looks 'so beautiful that he seemed an angel rather than a man'. In 1524 Parmigianino moved to Rome, possibly via Florence, and his work became both grander and more graceful under the influence of  Raphael and  Michelangelo. The Vision of St Jerome (National Gallery, London, 1526-27) is his most important work of this time, showing the disturbing emotional intensity he created with his elongated forms, disjointed sense of space, chill lighting, and lascivious atmosphere. Parmigianino left Rome after it was sacked by German troops in 1527 and moved to Bologna. In 1531 he returned to Parma and contracted to paint frescoes in Sta Maria della Steccata. He failed to complete the work, however, and was eventually imprisoned for breach of contract. Vasari says he neglected the work because he was infatuated with alchemy — 'he allowed his beard to grow long and disordered ... he neglected himself and grew melancholy and eccentric.' His later paintings show no falling off in his powers, however, and his work reaches its apotheosis in his celebrated Madonna of the Long Neck (Uffizi, Florence, c. 1535). The forms of the figures are extraordinarily elongated and tapering and the painting has a refinement and grace that place it among the archetypal works of Mannerism. Parmigianino's range extended beyond religious works. He painted a highly erotic Cupid Carving his Bow (Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna, 1535), and was one of the subtlest portraitists of his age (two superb examples are in the Museo di Capodimonte, Naples). The landscape backgrounds to his religious works have a mysterious and visionary quality that influenced Niccolo dell' Abbate and through him French art. Parmigianino, whose draughtsmanship was exquisite, also made designs for engravings and chiaroscuro woodcuts and seems to have been the first Italian artist to produce original etchings from his own designs.

41431,Gian Lorenzo Bernini,1598,1680,"Italian artist who was perhaps the greatest sculptor of the 17th century and an outstanding architect as well. Bernini created the Baroque style of sculpture and developed it to such an extent that other artists are of only minor importance in a discussion of that style. Early years Bernini's career began under his father, Pietro Bernini, a Florentine sculptor of some talent who ultimately moved to Rome. The young prodigy worked so diligently that he earned the praise of the painter Annibale Carracci and the patronage of Pope Paul V and soon established himself as a wholly independent sculptor. He was strongly influenced by his close study of the antique Greek and Roman marbles in the Vatican, and he also had an intimate knowledge of High Renaissance painting of the early 16th century. His study of Michelangelo is revealed in the St Sebastian (c. 1617), carved for Cardinal Maffeo Barberini, who was later Pope Urban VIII and Bernini's greatest patron. Bernini's early works attracted the attention of Cardinal Scipione Borghese, a member of the reigning papal family. Under his patronage, Bernini carved his first important life-size sculptural groups. The series shows Bernini's progression from the almost haphazard single view of Aeneas, Anchises and Ascanius Fleeing Troy (1619; Borghese Gallery, Rome) to strong frontality in Pluto and Proserpina (1621-22; Borghese Gallery) and then to the hallucinatory vision of Apollo and Daphne (1622-24; Borghese Gallery), which was intended to be viewed from one spot as if it were a relief. In his David (1623-24; Borghese Gallery), Bernini depicts the figure casting a stone at an unseen adversary. Several portrait busts that Bernini executed during this period, including that of Cardinal Robert Bellarmine (1623-24), show a new awareness of the relationship between head and body and display an ability to depict fleeting facial expressions with acute realism. These marble works show an unparalleled virtuosity in carving that obdurate material to achieve the delicate effects usually found only in bronze sculptures. Bernini's sensual awareness of the surface textures of skin and hair and his novel sense of shading broke with the tradition of Michelangelo and marked the emergence of a new period in the history of Western sculpture. Patronage of Urban VIII With the pontificate of Urban VIII (1623-44), Bernini entered a period of enormous productivity and artistic development. Urban VIII urged his protégé to paint and to practice architecture. His first architectural work was the remodeled Church of Santa Bibiana in Rome. At the same time, Bernini was commissioned to build a symbolic structure over the tomb of St Peter in St Peter's Basilica in Rome. The result is the famous immense gilt-bronze baldachin executed between 1624 and 1633. Its twisted columns derive from the early Christian columns that had been used in the altar screen of Old St Peter's. Bernini's most original contribution to the final work is the upper framework of crowning volutes flanked by four angels that supports the orb and cross. The baldachin is perfectly proportioned to its setting, and one hardly realizes that it is as tall as a four-story building. Its lively outline moving upward to the triumphant crown, its dark colour heightened with burning gold, give it the character of a living organism. An unprecedented fusion of sculpture and architecture, the baldachin is the first truly Baroque monument. It ultimately formed the centre of a programmatic decoration designed by Bernini for the interior of St Peter's. Bernini next supervised the decoration of the four piers supporting the dome of St Peter's with colossal statues, though only one of the latter, St Longinus, was designed by him. He also made a series of portrait busts of Urban VIII, but the first bust to achieve the quality of his earlier portraits is that of his great patron, Cardinal Scipione Borghese (1632; Borghese Gallery). The cardinal is shown in the act of speaking and moving, and the action is caught at a moment that seems to reveal all the characteristic qualities of the subject. Bernini's architectural duties increased after the death of Carlo Maderno in 1629, when Bernini became architect of St Peter's and of the Palazzo Barberini. By this time he was not only executing works himself but also having to rely on assistance from others as the number of his commissions grew. He was successful in organizing his studio and planning his work so that sculptures and ornamentations produced by a team actually seem to be all of a piece. Bernini's work, then and always, was also shaped by his fervent Roman Catholicism (he attended mass every day and took communion twice a week). He would agree with the formulations of the Council of Trent (1545-63) that the purpose of religious art was to teach and inspire the faithful and to serve as propaganda for the Roman Catholic church. Religious art should always be intelligible and realistic, and, above all, it should serve as an emotional stimulus to piety. The development of Bernini's religious art was largely determined by his conscientious efforts to conform to those principles. Under Urban VIII Bernini began to produce new and different kinds of monuments - tombs and fountains. The tomb of Urban VIII (1628-47; St Peter's, Rome) shows the pope seated with his arm raised in a commanding gesture, while below him are two white marble figures representing the Virtues. Bernini also designed a revolutionary series of small tomb memorials, of which the most impressive is that of Maria Raggi (1643). But his fountains are his most obvious contribution to the city of Rome. His first, the Barcaccia in the Piazza di Spagna (1627-29), is analogous to the baldachin in its fusion of sculpture and architecture. The Triton Fountain in the Piazza Barberini (1642-43) is a dramatic transformation of a Roman architectonic fountain - the superposed basins of the traditional geometric piazza fountain appearing to have come alive. Four dolphins raise a huge shell supporting the sea god, who blows water upward out of a conch. Bernini's early architectural projects, however, were not invariably successful. In 1637 he began to erect campaniles, or bell towers, over the facade of St Peter's. But, in 1646, when their weight began to crack the building, they were pulled down, and Bernini was temporarily disgraced. Patronage of Innocent X and Alexander VII Bernini's most spectacular public monuments date from the mid-1640s to the 1660s. The Fountain of the Four Rivers in Rome's Piazza Navona (1648-51) supports an ancient Egyptian obelisk over a hollowed-out rock, surmounted by four marble figures symbolizing four major rivers of the world. This fountain is one of his most spectacular works. The greatest single example of Bernini's mature art is the Cornaro Chapel in Santa Maria della Vittoria, in Rome, which completes the evolution begun early in his career. The chapel, commissioned by Cardinal Federigo Cornaro, is in a shallow transept in the small church. Its focal point is his sculpture of The Ecstasy of St Teresa (1645-52), a depiction of a mystical experience of the great Spanish Carmelite reformer Teresa of Ávila. In representing Teresa's vision, during which an angel pierced her heart with a fiery arrow of divine love, Bernini followed Teresa's own description of the event. The sculptured group, showing the transported saint swooning in the void, covered by cascading drapery, is revealed in celestial light within a niche over the altar, where the architectural and decorative elements are richly joined and articulated. At left and right, in spaces resembling opera boxes, numerous members of the Cornaro family are found in spirited postures of conversation, reading, or prayer. The Cornaro Chapel carries Bernini's ideal of a three-dimensional picture to its apex. The figures of St Teresa and the angel are sculptured in white marble, but the viewer cannot tell whether they are in the round or merely in high relief. The natural daylight that falls on the figures from a hidden source above and behind them is part of the group, as are the gilt rays behind. The Ecstasy of St Teresa is not sculpture in the conventional sense. Instead, it is a framed pictorial scene made up of sculpture, painting, and light that also includes the worshiper in a religious drama. In his later years, the growing desire to control the environments of his statuary led Bernini to concentrate more and more on architecture. Of the churches he designed after completing the Cornaro Chapel, the most impressive is that of Sant'Andrea al Quirinale (1658-70) in Rome, with its dramatic high altar, soaring dome, and unconventionally sited oval plan. But Bernini's greatest architectural achievement is the colonnade enclosing the piazza before St Peter's Basilica. The chief function of the large space was to hold the crowd that gathered for the papal benediction on Easter and other special occasions. Bernini planned a huge oval attached to the church by a trapezoidal forecourt - forms that he compared to the encircling arms of the mother church. The freestanding colonnades were a novel solution to the need for a penetrable enclosure. The piazza guides the visitor toward the church and counterbalances the overly wide facade of St Peter's. Bernini's oval encloses a space centred on the Vatican obelisk, which had been moved before the church by Sixtus V in 1586. Bernini moved an older fountain by Maderno into the long axis of the piazza and built a twin on the other side to make a scenographic whole. The analogies to Bernini's oval plan of Sant'Andrea al Quirinale are fascinating, as are the differences in meaning and function. Bernini's most spectacular religious decoration is the Throne of St Peter, or the Cathedra Petri (1657-66), a gilt-bronze cover for the medieval wooden throne (cathedra) of the pope. Bernini's task was not only to make a decorative cover for the chair but also to create a meaningful goal in the apse of St Peter's for the pilgrim's journey through the great church. The seat is seemingly supported by four imposing bronze figures representing theological doctors of the early church: Saints Ambrose, Athanasius, John Chrysostom, and Augustine. Above, a golden glory of angels on clouds and rays of light emanates from the Dove of the Holy Spirit, which is painted on an oval window. The cathedra was produced about the same time as the piazza, and the contrast between these two works shows Bernini's versatility. Both works were done for the Chigi pope, Alexander VII (1655-67), who was one of Bernini's greatest patrons. The tomb that Bernini designed for Alexander VII (1671-78; St Peter's) was largely executed by his pupils. In addition to his large works, Bernini continued to produce a few portrait busts. The first of these, of Francesco I d'Este, duke of Modena (1650-51; Este Gallery and Museum, Modena), culminates his revolution in portraiture. Much of the freedom and spontaneity of the bust of Cardinal Scipione Borghese is kept, but it is united with a heroic pomp and grandiose movement that portray the ideals of the Baroque age as much as the man. Trip to France Bernini went to Paris in 1665, in what was his only prolonged absence from Rome. The trip was made in response to invitations that for many years had been extended to him by King Louis XIV, and the purpose was the design of a new French royal residence. By this time, Bernini was so famous that crowds lined the streets of each city along the route to watch him pass. His initial reception in Paris was equally triumphant, but he soon offended his sensitive hosts by imperiously praising the art and architecture of Italy at the expense of that of France. His statements made him unpopular at the French court and were to some degree responsible for the rejection of his designs for the Louvre. The only relic of Bernini's visit to France is his great bust of Louis XIV, a linear, vertical, and stable portrait, in which the Sun King gazes out with godlike authority. The image set a standard for royal portraits that lasted 100 years. Later years Bernini's late works in sculpture are inevitably overshadowed by his grandiose projects for St Peter's, but a few of them are of outstanding interest. For the Chigi Chapel in the Church of Santa Maria del Popolo in Rome, he carved two groups, Daniel in the Lions' Den and Habakkuk and the Angel (1655-61). These works show the beginnings of his late style: elongation of the body, expressive gesture, and simplified yet emphatic emotional expression. The same characteristics are already found in the figures supporting the Throne of St Peter and culminate in the moving Angels for the Sant'Angelo Bridge in Rome, which Bernini redecorated with the help of assistants between 1667 and 1671. Pope Clement IX (1667-69) so prized the Angels carved by Bernini that they were never set up on the bridge and are now in the church of Sant'Andrea delle Fratte in Rome. The redecorated Sant'Angelo Bridge leading across the Tiber forms an introduction to the Vatican, and Bernini's other works - the piazza, Scala Regia, and the baldachin and cathedra within St Peter's - form progressively more powerful expressions of papal power to support and inspire Roman Catholic pilgrims to the site. Bernini completed one more decoration in St Peter's in his last years: the altar of the Santissimo Sacramento Chapel (1673-74). The pliant, human adoration of the angels contrasts with the timeless architecture of the bronze tabernacle that they flank and typifies Bernini's late style. In his last years he seems to have found the inexorable laws of architecture a consoling antithesis to the transitory human state. Bernini's greatest late work is the simple Altieri Chapel in San Francesco a Ripa (c. 1674) in Rome. The relatively deep space above the altar reveals a statue representing the death of the Blessed Ludovica Albertoni. Bernini consciously separated architecture, sculpture, and painting for different roles, reversing the process that culminated in the Cornaro Chapel. In that sense, the Altieri Chapel is more traditional, a variation on his church interiors of the preceding years. Instead of filling the arched opening, the sculpted figure of Ludovica lies at the bottom of a large volume of space, and is illuminated by a heavenly light that plays on the drapery gathered over her recumbent figure. Her hands weakly clutching her breast make explicit her painful death. Bernini died at the age of 81, after having served eight popes, and when he died he was widely considered not only Europe's greatest artist but also one of its greatest men. He was the last of Italy's remarkable series of universal geniuses, and the Baroque style he helped create was the last Italian style to become an international standard. His death marked the end of Italy's artistic hegemony in Europe. The style he evolved was carried on for two more generations in various parts of Europe by the architects Mattia de' Rossi and Carlo Fontana in Rome, Johann Bernhard Fischer von Erlach in Austria, and the brothers Cosmas and Egid Quirin Asam in Bavaria, among others.

15112,Jean-Louis Lemoyne,1665,1755,"Sculptor, part of a family of French sculptors. Jean-Louis Lemoyne (1665-1755) was a pupil of Coysevox and is remembered mainly for portrait busts in his master's manner. His brother Jean-Baptiste I (1679-1731) was a figure and portrait sculptor of no great distinction. Jean-Louis's son, Jean-Baptiste II was the outstanding member of the family, becoming official sculptor to Louis XV. He did much large-scale work at Versailles and elsewhere, but is renowned particularly for the vivacity of his portraits. Among his pupils were Falconet, Houdon and Pigalle. Jean-Louis Lemoyne was the son of a painter, himself the son of a sculptor who had worked on the façade of the Louvre. A pupil of Antoine Coysevox, he won the Prix de Rome in 1687 with a low relief of the Flood (untraced), although he did not undertake the customary journey to Italy. Instead he entered the Ecole Académique at Bordeaux, presenting as his morceau de réception a portrait of Louis XIV (walnut, 1692; untraced). While in Bordeaux he modelled his bust of Michel Du Plessis (marble, 1694; Bordeaux, Musée d'Aquitaine), one of the principal architects of the city. By 1697 he had returned to Paris and was received (reçu) as a member of the Académie Royale de Peinture et de Sculpture in 1703 on presentation of a magisterial, over life-size bust of Jules Hardouin-Mansart. A contemporary and presumably friend of Robert Le Lorrain, he was to receive many official commissions in Paris and for the royal residences. And he was also to show a marked gift for portraiture. He is remembered mainly for portrait busts in Coysevox's manner. Despite his extremely long life, Jean-Louis did not enjoy an equally long career, for he had been prevented by blindness from working for some fifteen or so years before his death at the age of ninety. Already in 1728 he had asked for his son Jean-Baptiste to remain in Paris rather than take up the pensioner's post that was his in Rome. From that date onwards it is likely that Jean-Louis' work benefited from his son's assistance. "

33535,Bernard Baron,1696,1762,"French engraver active in England. He was the pupil and son-in-law of Nicolas-Henry Tardieu. In 1712 the French engraver Claude Du Bosc (active c. 1711-1740) brought Baron to London to assist with the engraving of murals at Marlborough House. In 1724 Baron engraved eight plates of the Life of Achilles after Rubens. Five years later he returned to Paris where he engraved L'Accord parfait, the first of his four prints for the celebrated Recueil Jullienne collection of the works of Antoine Watteau. Two of the other Watteau paintings that he engraved belonged to the painter's English physician Dr Richard Mead and the fourth, Les Deux Cousines, Baron owned himself. A drawing by Watteau of an engraver at work (British Museum, London) is believed to depict Baron. While in France, Baron also engraved Titian's Pardo Venus for the second volume (published 1742) of the Recueil Crozat, a compendium of prints of Italian pictures in French collections. The inclusion of a portrait of Baron in a painting by Gavin Hamilton, A Conversation of Virtuosis at the Kings Armes (1734-35; National Portrait Gallery, London), demonstrates that he mixed with many of England's leading artists, sculptors and architects. In 1745 he was one of four Frenchmen selected by William Hogarth to engrave plates for Marriage à la Mode in order to appeal to an aristocratic audience. Baron engraved portraits by Hogarth and Allan Ramsay and works by Holbein, van Dyck and Titian, including the latter's Vendramin Family. "

15684,Maximilien Luce,1858,1941,"French painter and printmaker. He was born and brought up in the working-class surroundings of Montparnasse, and an interest in the daily routines and labours of the petit peuple of Paris informs much of his art. After an apprenticeship with the wood-engraver Henri Théophile Hildebrand (b 1824), in 1876 he entered the studio of the wood-engraver Eugène Froment where he assisted in the production of engravings for various French and foreign publications such as L'Illustration and The Graphic. He also sporadically attended classes at the Académie Suisse and in the studio of Carolus-Duran. In Froment's studio he came into contact with the artists Léo Gausson and Emile-Gustave Peduzzi (Cavallo-Peduzzi; 1851-1917) and in their company began painting landscape subjects in and around the town of Lagny-sur-Marne. He earned his living as a wood carver. In his painting, he became influenced by Impressionism. In 1887 he exhibited at the Salon des Indépendants, and in 1888 he had his first individual exhibition. He met Pissarro, Seurat, and Signac and joined the Neo-Impressionist group. Like Camille Pissarro, Luce was active with anarchist groups in Paris in the 1890s, and in 1894 served a brief prison term. During World War I, Luce painted war scenes, depicting soldiers struggling against the horrors of the Great War. Until 1904 he lived in Montmartre, whose streets became a favourite subject for his paintings. Beside street scenes and motifs like factories and wharfs, he painted numerous landscape paintings on his travels through the Étamps, Normandy and Brittany. "

From the mid-1550s to about 1570 he worked for the publisher Hieronymus Cock in Antwerp, who was among the earliest print publishers in the Netherlands. Pieter van der Heyden produced more than 150 prints for the Cock publishing house, reproducing the designs of Bosch, Bruegel and other Flemish artists such as Hans Bol, Frans Floris and Lambert Lombard.

34566,Frederick Carl Frieseke,1874,1939,"American Impressionist painter who spent most of his life as an expatriate in France. An influential member of the Giverny art colony, his paintings often concentrated on various effects of dappled sunlight. Frieseke began his professional life as a cartoonist. Deciding to become a painter, he studied first at the Art Institute of Chicago from 1893 to 1896 followed by a year of instruction at the Art Students League of New York. He went to France to further his education, arriving in Paris in 1897. He worked in the atelier of Jean-Joseph Benjamin-Constant and Jean-Paul Laurens at the Académie Julian. He studied very briefly in James McNeill Whistler's Académie Carmen. Nonetheless, Whistler's influence on Frieseke's developing style was strong. Frieseke achieved his first successes with paintings of the nude, one of which was purchased by the French Government in 1904. Parisian parks and boulevards and summer landscapes painted in the country rounded out his oeuvre at the turn of the 20th century. Frieseke is believed to have visited Giverny as early as 1900; a summer visit in 1905 is documented; and in 1906 he and his wife moved into a two-story cottage that adjoined the property of Claude Monet. At Giverny his colleagues included the American painters Guy Rose, Lawton Parker, Edmund Greacen, and Richard E. Miller, with whose work Frieseke's is often compared. While he maintained an apartment and studio in Paris all his life, Giverny was Frieseke's summer residence for fourteen years. Once settled there, Frieseke began to focus on painting women in colourful garden settings. While he drew figures solidly, he rendered the surroundings in which he placed his models with the broken brushwork of Impressionism. Frieseke's palette during his Giverny period primarily consisted of greens, blues and violets, dazzling golds and oranges, and creamy whites, which capture and reflect the brilliant summer sunlight. In 1920, Frieseke bought a summer home at Le Mesnil-sur-Blangy in Normandy and left the Giverny art colony. He commenced production of a large group of canvases representing frontally posed female figures, most often using his daughter Frances as model. The palette is darker than that of his Giverny period and shows more interest in qualities of chiaroscuro as he explored less brilliant light effects. Works painted after 1920 evidence a great deal of control on Frieseke's part, which, combined with the deeper palette, contribute to a sense of psychological awareness and intensity. Frieseke exhibited extensively throughout his lifetime, both in the United States and in his adopted France. He earned a medal from the St. Louis Exposition of 1904; the Temple Gold Medal from the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in 1913; a prize at the Panama-Pacific International Exposition of 1915; and the William A. Clark Award from the Corcoran Gallery of Art in 1935. Frieseke's work is represented in the permanent collections of the Telfair Museum of Art, Savannah, Georgia; North Carolina Museum of Art, Raleigh; The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York; the Art Institute of Chicago; Museum of Fine Arts, Boston; Museo d'Art Moderna de Ca1Pesaro, Venice; and the Terra Museum of American Art, Chicago.

21764,Léon Richet,1847,1907,"French painter of the generation of painters raised during the height of the Barbizon school. He was a student of Narcisse Virgile Diaz de la Pena, as well as Jules Lefebvre and Gustave Boulanger. He began a Salon career in 1869, received an honourable mention in 1885 and was awarded second place medals in 1888 and 1901. However, his Barbizon-style works figure more importantly in his career than his Salon submissions. Richet was very influenced by the works of Rousseau. The majority of Richet's landscapes are of the forest of Fountainebleau, although he did also paint views at Moret sur Loing, Loiret, Burgundy, Normandy, and along the Seine. His compositions are often airy and open, unlike the sometimes enclosed or shadowy views of nature of some of his mentors and counterparts, such as Diaz and Corot. Richet was a very prolific artist and his works appear in many collections. Like many painters of the 19th century, Richet traveled extensively. He painted in the countryside of Auvergne, Picardie, and seascapes in Tréport and as far away as Guéret in the centre of France. He even traveled to Belgium. His subjects were not limited to Barbizon or the Fontainebleau forest. Richet wanted to record the nature and the effects of light on the diverse landscapes of his travels. "

40627,Maerten van Heemskerck,1498,1574,"Netherlandish painter, worked with Scorel in Haarlem 1527-29 and learned most of the Italianate manner from him before going to Italy in 1532 himself. Before he left he gave his St Luke Painting the Virgin to the Haarlem Guild (now in Haarlem, Hals Museum); this is almost a parody of the Italian manner, as conceived by a Northerner at second hand. In Rome he made a large number of drawings (1532-35) of the antiquities and works of art, and two of his sketchbooks (Berlin) are invaluable evidence for the monuments of antiquity as they existed in the 16th century, as well as for such things as the building of New St Peter's. He settled in Haarlem in 1537 and worked there for the rest of his life except for a flight to Amsterdam (1572-73) while the Spaniards were besieging Haarlem. He painted a number of fine portraits, as well as Italianate religious pictures. There are works by him in Amsterdam (Rijksmuseum), Barnard Castle (Bowes Museum), Berlin, Brussels, Cambridge (Fitzwilliams, Self Portrait with the Colosseum in the Background), Kassel, Ghent, The Hague, Lille, Linköping Cathedral, Sweden, New York (Metropolitan Museum), as well as in Haarlem and elsewhere.

After a period in Italy, sometime after 1618, he joined the workshop of Peter Paul Rubens. He is one of the few artists whose collaboration with Rubens is documented. He is mentioned several times between 1625 and 1628, for example in 1625, when he was involved in the installation of some of the 44 decorative panels ('the Medici Cycle') commissioned from Rubens in 1622 by Marie de' Medici for the Palais de Luxembourg in Paris. He may also have collaborated in painting some of the panels. In 1628 he became a Master in the Antwerp Guild of St Luke. Immediately afterwards he left for Paris, where he acquired a considerable reputation, not only as a painter but also as a print publisher. In 1648 he was one of the founders of the Académie Royale de Peinture et de Sculpture. After 1649 various Flemish archives mention him again: first in Brussels (until c. 1655) and then in Antwerp, where he settled. "

The earliest woodcuts to be firmly attributed to him were for Ulrich Pinder's 'Der beschlossen Gart des Rosenkranz Maria' of 1505, which he must have made while in the workshop of Albrecht Dürer; and he was probably also an assistant of Hans von Kulmbach. From 1512 to 1513, Dürer employed him to make woodcuts for his Triumphal Arch. His most important painting, the Artelshofener altarpiece, signed and dated 1514, and originally in the Lorenzkirche, Nuremberg, is now in Munich (Bayerisches Nationalmuseum). From 1513 to 1518 he executed altarpieces for the monastery at Heilsbronn (now Heilsbronn Münster, and Nuremberg, Germanisches Nationalmuseum). A few drawings have been attributed to Traut on a stylistic basis; they are to be found in Paris (Louvre), Erlangen (Universitätsbibliothek), Nuremberg (Germanisches Nationalmuseum) and elsewhere. "

He is known now mostly for his literary nonsense in poetry and prose and especially his limericks, a form he popularised. His principal areas of work as an artist were threefold: as a draughtsman employed to illustrate birds and animals; making coloured drawings during his journeys, which he reworked later, sometimes as plates for his travel books; as a (minor) illustrator of Alfred Tennyson's poems. As an author, he is known principally for his popular nonsense collections of poems, songs, short stories, botanical drawings, recipes, and alphabets. He also composed and published twelve musical settings of Tennyson's poetry. A peripatetic traveller his whole life, Lear was captivated by Italy in his mid-twenties and spent a great deal of time there over many years. He would later make Italy his home towards the end of his life. "

34834,George Henry Harlow,1787,1819,"English painter. After briefly attending Westminster School in London, he trained as a painter, first under Hendrik Frans de Cort (1742-1810), then under Samuel Drummond (1765-1844) and finally with Thomas Lawrence. Although Lawrence was paid a considerable sum to accept Harlow into his studio he did not formally teach him; instead he allowed the young man to copy and occasionally help with his work. After 18 months the two fell out and Harlow left to pursue his own career though the influence of Lawrence's style was lasting. Harlow made his début at the Royal Academy in 1804 with a portrait of Dr Thornton (untraced) and thereafter concentrated on this genre. There is a portrait of the painter James Northcote (c. 1815; National Portrait Gallery, London) by him. He also attempted history painting, though with less success, partly due to his lack of a proper art education. He produced a number of portraits of actors and actresses (e.g. Charles Mathews, pencil, 1814; National Portrait Gallery, London). In order to make up for his deficient education, in 1818 he travelled to Italy to study the Old Masters. There he became greatly admired for his technical facility and was befriended by Canova. He caused considerable amazement in Rome by painting a full-size copy of Raphael's the Transfiguration (1517-20; Pinacoteca Vaticana, Rome) in only 18 days and was elected an Academician of Merit of the Accademia di San Luca in Rome, a rare honour for an English artist. He died from a throat infection soon after his return to England in 1819. An exhibition of his works was held after his death in Pall Mall, London. "

42477,Giovanni Girolamo Savoldo,1475,1548,"Italian painter, born in Brescia, first documented in Florence in 1508, and active mainly in Venice. His output was small and his career is said to have been unsuccessful, but he is now remembered as a highly attractive minor master whose work stands somewhat apart from the main Venetian tradition. Savoldo was the most accomplished of sixteenth-century Brescian painters. He carefully studied the effects of light and reflections in a way that was most unusual for the time. His forte was night scenes, in which he gave his lyrical sensibility and liking for unusual light effects full play. One of the best-known examples is Mary Magdalen Approaching the Sepulchre, of which several versions exist, one in the National Gallery, London. Even though Savoldo spent much of his artistic career in Venice, he is considered to be part of the Brescia school. One reason for this is that many of his patrons were from his native city, but it is also because of his links to the current of realism and acute psychological portrayal. This could be found both in Renaissance Brescia, exemplified by Romanino, and Bergamo, as seen in Lotto and later Moroni. The writer Pietro Aretino described Savoldo as 'decrepit' in 1548 and he is not heard of thereafter. "

He took drawing lessons from the Genoese painter Alessandro Maria Grimaldi (1659-1732), and with Grimaldi's son Alexander (1714-1800) he went c. 1736 to Birmingham, where he worked as a glass painter. He married Grimaldi's daughter, Arabella, and moved to London in the mid-1730s. He lived in Covent Garden and while there became acquainted with the engraver Louis Pierre Boitard (d. 1758). Possibly because of his proximity to the London theatres, Worlidge's early works were often theatrical portraits. He made a drawing on vellum of Theophilus Cibber (1735; Windsor Castle, Royal Collection), a painting of David Garrick as Tancred (c. 1745; London, Victoria and Albert Museum) and a miniature of the mimic Samuel Foote (London, Victoria and Albert Museum). His watercolour of the comic actress Kitty Clive as the Fine Lady in Garrick's 'Lethe' (untraced) was copied for a Bow porcelain figurine (c. 1750-52). In the 1750s and 1760s Worlidge worked in the Bath area, drawing and painting portraits in miniature, pencil, crayon and oil. His most popular works were portrait heads in pencil, which were much in demand by fashionable Bath society. He exhibited at the Society of Artists in 1761 and 1765, and at the Free Society in 1762 and 1765-66. "

7256,François Duquesnoy,1597,1643,"Flemish sculptor, active mainly in Roma where he settled in 1618. He was a friend of Poussin. sharing a house with him for some time, and became a leading figure in circle devoted to classical art. Alongside Algardi he came to be recognized as the outstanding sculptor in Rome after the great Bernini (who employed him on the decoration of the Baldacchino in St Peter's in 1627-8). and as with Algardi, his style was much more restrained and less Baroque than Bernini's. Duquesnoy's two major works are the statues of Sta Susanna (Sta Maria di Loreto, 1629-33) and St Andrew (St Peter's, 1629-40). He also produced many small bronzes that spread his fame, Duquesnoy was particularly renowned for his handling of putti, and it is curious that someone who so unaffectedly depicted the beauty and charm of children seems to have been mentally unstable; he was a chronic procrastinator and the diarist John Evelyn, visiting Rome in 1644, said that he 'died mad' because his St Andrew 'was placed in a bad light'. Duquesnoy's father and brother were sculptors; Jérôme the Elder (c. 1570-1641) and Jérôme the Younger (1602-1654). His father is remembered mainly for the famous Manneken pis fountain (1619) behind the town hall in Brussels. His brother worked with Francois in Rome and took a somewhat diluted Baroque style back to Flanders with him. The tomb of Bishop Antonius Triest in Ghent Cathedral (c. 1651) is considered his finest work. He is perhaps best remembered, however, for his sticky end; he was executed by strangulation in Ghent for committing sodomy in a church. "

27609,Franz von Stuck,1863,1928,"German draughtsman, illustrator, printmaker, decorative artist, painter, sculptor and architect. He was noted for his treatment of erotic and comic aspects of mythological themes. He drew eagerly as a child, soon becoming a gifted caricaturist. From 1878 to 1881 he attended the Kunstgewerbeschule in Munich, where he received particular encouragement from Ferdinand Barth (1842-1892). From 1881 to 1885 he studied at the Munich Akademie, where he was taught by Wilhelm Lindenschmit (1829-1895) and Ferdinand Löfftz (1845-1910). During his student years Stuck earned a living from designs for decorative painting, and he made notable contributions (1880-84) to the humorous Munich periodical Fliegende Blätter and to the Viennese serial publications Allegorien und Embleme and Karten und Vignetten. These did much to establish his reputation as both a skilled and a witty draughtsman. Around 1892 he became one of the founders of the Munich Sezession and his Symbolist period is also of this decade. Around 1895 he began teaching at the Munich academy that he once attended. Some of his pupils at the academy included Klee, Albers, and Kandinsky. Among Von Stuck's architectural creations is the Villa Stuck Prinzregentenstrasse, Munich, which is now a museum. Stuck's subject matter was primarily drawn from mythology, inspired by the work of Arnold Böcklin. Large, heavy forms dominate most of his paintings and point toward his proclivities for sculpture. His seductive female nudes, in the role of the femme fatale, are a prime example of popular Symbolist content. Stuck paid close attention to the frames for his paintings and generally designed them himself with such careful use of panels, gilt carving and inscriptions that the frames must be taken as an integral part of the overall piece.

42709,Francescuccio Ghissi,,,"Italian painter. He was the leading 14th-century painter from the Marches after Allegretto Nuzi, with whom he collaborated. The overall pattern of his activity is unknown. Most of his surviving panels depict the Madonna of Humility. Frescoes in S Francesco in Sanseverino were recorded but are now lost. Between his earliest known work, the signed Madonna of Humility (1359; Fabriano, S Domenico), and the Madonna of Humility with an Angel (1374; Montegiorgio, S Andrea) his draughtsmanship and facial modelling became more assured and the design of the basic triangular group more elegant. Another example (Fermo, S Domenico) shows the richness of his decorative repertory in the painted cloth and in the elaborately foliated gold ground. Ghissi was influenced by Nuzi, but his works, with respect to the latter, are much more rigid and characteristically archaic, leading one to think of a more provincial and intensely devotional expression.

41349,Romeyn de Hooghe,1645,1708,"Dutch etcher, painter and caricaturist. He is best known for his political caricatures of Louis XIV of France and for his prints glorifying William III, Stadholder of the Netherlands and King of England. During his career, de Hooghe produced over 3500 prints. He also illustrated books, and his illustrations can be found in some of the most important texts of his period. In 1668 de Hooghe was in Paris, where he produced some book illustrations, but he returned to Amsterdam, where from 1670 to 1691 he illustrated the annual newsheet Hollandsche Mercurius. Early in 1687 he was living in Haarlem following a dispute with the Amsterdam Church Council. In 1687-8 he was a Commissioner of Justice in Haarlem, and in 1688 he built a house and a drawing school. He also made a large map of the city of Haarlem. De Hooghe is an important representative of the late Dutch Baroque. His style is characterized by strong contrasts of lights and darks and an expressive composition. In his prints he combined contemporary personalities with allegorical figures. His prints are numerous, but few of his drawings survive and his paintings are rarer still. He created popular topical and satirical prints, but also drew pornographic illustrations as well as designing the gardens of Het Loo palace. With his extensive oeuvre he offers us an insight into the final decades of the Dutch Golden Age. "
15514,Lambert Lombard,1506,1566,"Flemish painter, draughtsman, architect, humanist and numismatist. He belonged to the generation of artists who sought to revive Flemish painting by turning to the art of antiquity and the Italian Renaissance. However, because of his northern training, he assimilated his models with difficulty and produced a hesitant form of art, one that was academic and cold. He was nonetheless an important innovator in the Low Countries through his investigation of the forms and compositions of Classical art. He also founded the first academy of art in the Low Countries and was influential through the prime role he accorded to scholarship in the training of the artist. Lombard was active as a designer of prints and as an architect, and seems to have run a large workshop, particularly in his later career. He was enormously influential on the development of art in Liège in the 16th Century, and his resolutely classicizing anti-primitive taste established a tradition which lasted in Liège throughout the following century as well. His masterpiece is the celebrated altarpiece panels for the Saint-Denis retable done circa 1533. (The panels are currently divided between the church of Saint-Denis and the Musée de l'Art Wallon, in Liège, and the Musée des Beaux-Arts in Brussels). Apart from the Saint-Denis panels, very few paintings by him are known. "

34249,Thomas Wilmer Dewing,1851,1938,"American painter. As a child he was interested in both drawing and in playing the violin; this early interest in music would later reappear in the themes of many of his paintings. By 1872, after a period of apprenticeship in a lithography shop, Dewing was listing his profession as ""artist."" He studied paintings in the collection of the Boston Museum of Fine Arts, especially the works of Jean Baptiste Siméon Chardin. He worked briefly in Albany, New York, during 1875-1876 and in July 1876 went to Europe. In Paris, Dewing entered the Académie Julian, where the course of instruction, under Gustave Boulanger and Jules-Joseph Lefebvre, centred on anatomical drawing and modeling. While in Paris, Dewing became acquainted with the American painter William Merritt Chase and, like Chase, developed a particular interest in Spanish painting. Dewing returned to America early in 1878, stopping first in New York and then going to Boston, where he became an assistant at the newly founded School of the Museum of Fine Arts. In the late 1870s he participated in several Boston exhibitions, showing paintings that recalled the fashionable academic works of French artists such as Jean-Léon Gérôme and Jean-Louis Hamon (1821-1874). Deciding that New York provided greater opportunities for an aspiring artist, Dewing moved there in 1880. He soon came into contact with many of the young artists who had formed the Society of American Artists out of dissatisfaction with the National Academy of Design. Dewing was elected a member of the Society in 1880 and in 1881 began teaching at the Art Students League, where he renewed his friendship with Chase. In 1881 he married the artist Maria Oakey, through whom he had been introduced to an active cultural circle. In 1886, the Dewings moved to the famous Studio Building at 3 North Washington Circle; by this time his works were exhibited regularly in New York shows and elsewhere. By the late 1880s Dewing had formed his basic style and subject matter - elegant, refined women portrayed with an extremely limited range of colours and placed in sparse interiors or outdoors in soft green fields. He drew inspiration from the paintings of the Dutch artist Johannes Vermeer and from the aesthetics of James A. M. Whistler and the English artist Albert Moore (1841-1893). His brushwork became increasingly soft and blurred. Dewing continued to paint actively in the early years of the twentieth century, receiving several awards. He did little work during the last decade of his life. "

His earliest dated work, The Virgin with the Souls of Purgatory (Prado, Madrid, 1517), was painted in Italy and is thoroughly Raphaelesque in style. Machuca was back in Spain by 1520, and although he worked mainly as a painter, he is most important as the architect of the Palace of Charles V in the grounds of the Alhambra in Granada, begun in 1527, which is completely Italianate in style. Most of Machuca's work as a painter has disappeared. "

His painting The Birth of Venus was shown at the Salon in 1863, and was bought by Napoleon III for his own personal collection. That same year he was made a professor of the École des Beaux-Arts. Cabanel's erotic imagery, cloaked in historicism, appealed to the propriety of the higher levels of society. He was a determined opponent of the Impressionists, especially Manet, although the refusal of the academic establishment to realize the importance of new ideas and sources of inspiration would eventually prove to be the undoing of the Academy.

Although Jan Wellens de Cock probably came from Leiden, possibly as early as 1503 and certainly from 1506 onwards, he was active in Antwerp as a painter, draughtsman and maybe also an engraver. Two of his four children became artists: Matthijs Cock was a serviceable painter of landscapes, and Hieronymus Cock became an engraver as well as owning the successful and influential publishing house Aux Quatre Vents. Hieronymus Cock was received into the Antwerp Guild of St Luke in 1546. He probably made a trip to Rome before 1550, the date when he etched and published a series of 25 views of Roman ruins. In 1548 he published a set of ornament designs by Cornelis Floris engraved by Balthazar van den Bos, and over the next two decades more than 1100 prints appeared bearing his name as publisher (Hieronymus Cock excudit) or that of his publishing house, Aux Quatre Vents (At the Sign of the Four Winds). According to van Mander, he also commissioned and dealt in paintings and became rich through these commercial activities. "

His work is vigorous and naturalistic and he marks the transition from the unselfconscious folk carver to the professional artist. He was one of the prime movers in the foundation of the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, which has many examples of his work.

He was one of the foremost Symbolist artists and active supporters of avant-garde art in late 19th-century Belgium. His wealthy family lived in Bruges from 1859 to 1864, moved to Brussels in 1865, where Khnopff remained until his death. The family spent the summers at a country home in Fosset, in the Ardennes. Fosset inspired numerous landscapes that owe a strong debt to Barbizon-style realism, which dominated advanced Belgian painting in the late 1870s. Khnopff abandoned law school in 1875, and, turning to literature and art, he studied with Xavier Mellery (1845-1921) at the Académie Royale des Beaux-Arts in Brussels. At the Exposition Universelle of 1878 in Paris, he discovered Gustave Moreau and Edward Burne-Jones, both indelibly influenced his art. He studied with Jules Lefebvre and Gustave Boulanger at the Académie Julian in Paris but was dissatisfied with their brand of Realism and continued searching for an original style and subject. He moved through several aesthetic options, starting with traditional allegory in his first public showing, with the Belgian exhibition society L'Essor, in 1881. The watercolour Passing Boulevard du Régent (1881), exhibited the following year, shows his awareness of current avant-garde practice with its realism and atmospheric effects. After Flaubert (1883), indebted to the striking light effects and rich impastos of Moreau's work of the 1870s and Gustave Flaubert's novel La Tentation de Saint Antoine (1874), marked his lifelong fascination with literature. It explores evocative expression, which, along with his association with the Jeune Belgique literary movement, put Khnopff in the Symbolist camp. In 1883, he was a founder-member of Les XX, the most avant-garde and internationalist art group in Europe. He designed their logo and exhibited Listening to Schumann (1883), a painting characterized by a Symbolist concern for introspection and an impressionist style indebted to James Ensor's Russian Music (1881). He also began to illustrate books at this time, producing some of his most puzzling images, for example, six illustrations for Lucien Solvay's Belle-Maman! suivi de Merveilles de la science (Paris, 1884). In the same year, he exhibited for the first time at the Paris Salon. "

20709,Johann Georg Platzer,1704,1761,"Austrian painter and draughtsman. He came from a family of painters in South Tyrol, studying first with his stepfather Josef Anton Kessler (d. 1721) and then with his uncle Christoph Platzer, court painter in Passau. In 1724 he painted an altarpiece for the church of St Helena in Deutschnofen. Probably after 1726 he went to Vienna, where he enrolled at the Akademie der Bildenden Künste and became a friend of Franz Christoph Janneck. Perhaps because of a stroke that impeded his work, he returned to St Michael in Eppan by 1755. Platzer produced a great number of small paintings, mostly on copper. He was the most important master of the conversation piece in 18th-century Austria, and his cultivated embourgeoisé public was fascinated by the virtuoso manner, lively colours and innumerable details of his compositions. According to the principles of decorum, he chose his models and style to suit the subject-matter: for histories and allegories he took his models from antiquity, the Renaissance and Italian and Flemish Baroque art, as in Samson's Revenge (Vienna, Belvedere). In his genre scenes and especially his conversation pieces, influences of the French Rococo and the Netherlandish cabinet painters are evident, while in his scenes of artists' studios, such as Sculptor's Workshop (Vienna, Hististorisches Museum), his academic knowledge is revealed. The repeated use of architectural motifs in his work is derived from northern Italian quadratura painting. Although his work is eclectic, it has a characteristic personal touch that distinguishes it from the comparable, though calmer and less detailed work of Janneck. "

After studying classics at the Lycée Louis Le Grand, he obtained a law degree in 1870, and during the Franco-Prussian War he was drafted into the Seine Garde Mobile (1870-71). He joined Léon Bonnat's studio in 1872 and passed the entrance examination for the Ecole des Beaux-Arts on 18 March 1873. The records of the Ecole make no mention of his work there, and his attendance seems to have been short-lived. He was very soon attracted by the innovative experiments, against academic teaching, of the young rebels who were to become known as the Impressionists. In 1874 Edgar Degas, whom Caillebotte had met at the house of their mutual friend Giuseppe de Nittis, asked him to take part in the First Impressionist Exhibition at the Nadar Gallery in the Boulevard des Capucines in Paris. However, it was only at the time of their second exhibition in April 1876 that, at Auguste Renoir's invitation, Caillebotte joined the Impressionist group. From then on he was one of the most regular participants in their exhibitions (1877, 1879, 1880, 1882). He organized the show of 1877 and made great efforts to restore the cohesion of the group by persuading Claude Monet to exhibit in 1879. Caillebotte painted some 500 works in a style often more realistic than that of his Impressionist friends. The painter will illustrate himself particularly in views of Paris streets made from high balconies, in scenes of working life, natural landscapes of gardens and parks, and in nautical scenes (on the Seine in Argenteuil and Yerres). Having inherited a large fortune from his parents, Caillebotte had no need to sell his pictures and could afford to provide crucial financial assistance for his artist friends. He purchased their work, much disparaged at the time, and amassed the famous collection of Impressionist masterpieces that he left to the State. "

15017,Hippolyte Lecomte,1781,1857,"French painter and lithographer. He was a pupil of Jean-Baptiste Regnault and Pierre-Antoine Mongin (1761-1827). He exhibited regularly at the Salon between 1804 and 1847 and received a first class medal as a genre painter in 1808. His reputation was based above all on his historical landscapes. Apart from a few contemporary subjects, his subjects were taken from an idealized view of the Middle Ages. He was one of the first landscape painters to turn to medieval history, but unlike most painters of historical landscape he emphasized the setting and tried to raise landscape to the level of history painting. However, he is best known for his ballet designs. Lecomte's wife, born Camille Vernet, was the sister of the painter Émile Jean-Horace Vernet; the caricaturist Jean Ignace Isidore Gérard, better known as ""J.J. Grandville"", worked in Lecomte's studio. His son, Charles Emile Hippolyte Lecomte-Vernet, was also a noted painter. "

34967,William Hogarth,1697,1764,"English painter and engraver. He trained as an engraver in the Rococo tradition, and by 1720 was established in London independently as an engraver on copper of billheads and book illustrations. In his spare time he studied painting, first at the St Martin's Lane Academy and later under Sir James Thornhill, whose daughter he married in 1729. By this time he had begun to make a name with small conversation pieces, and about 1730 he set up as a portrait painter. At about the same time he invented and popularized the use of a sequence of anecdotal pictures 'similar to representations on the stage' to point a moral and satirize social abuses. A Harlot's Progress (6 scenes, c. 1731; destroyed by fire) was followed by A Rake's Progress (8 scenes, Sir John Soane's Museum, London, c. 1735), and Marriage à la Mode (6 scenes, National Gallery, London, c. 1743), which each portray the punishment of vice in a somewhat lurid melodrama. Each series was painted with a view to being engraved, and the engravings had a wide sale and were popular with all classes. They were much pirated and Hogarth's campaigning against the profiteers led to the Copyright Act of 1735. 'I have endeavoured', he wrote, 'to treat my subjects as a dramatic writer: my picture is my stage, and men and women my players.' Hogarth, however, was much more than a preacher in paint. His satire was directed as much at pedantry and affectation as at immorality, and he saw himself to some extent as a defender of native common sense against a fashion for French and Italian mannerisms. In spite of his rabid xenophobia, Hogarth made some attempts to show he could paint in the Italian Grand Manner (Sigismunda, Tate, London, 1759). These, however, are generally considered his weakest works, and apart from his modern morality subjects he excelled mainly in portraiture. Captain Coram (Coram Foundation, London, 1740), which he regarded as his highest achievement in portraiture, shows that he could paint a portrait in the Baroque manner with complete confidence and without artificiality. However, he could not flatter or compromise and had not the disposition for a successful portraitist. From 1735 to 1755 he ran an academy in St Martin's Lane (independent of the one at which he had studied), and this became the main forerunner of the Royal Academy. In 1753 he published The Analysis of Beauty, a treatise on aesthetic theory which he wrote with the conviction that the views of a practising artist should carry greater weight than the theories of the connoisseur or dilettante. Hogarth was far and away the most important British artist of his generation. He was equally outstanding as a painter and engraver and by the force of his pugnacious personality as well as by the quality and originality of his work he freed British art from its domination by foreign artists. Because so much of his work has a 'literary' element, his qualities as a painter have often been overlooked, but his more informal pictures in particular show that his brushwork could live up to his inventive genius. The vigour and spontaneity of The Shrimp Girl (National Gallery, London, c. 1740), for example, have made it deservedly one of the most popular British paintings of the 18th century. "

34822,William Hamilton,1751,1801,"English painter and illustrator. The son of one of the assistants of Robert Adam (1728-1792), he was sent to Rome to be trained as an architectural draughtsman. He studied under Antonio Zucchi (who was later Adam's chief decorative painter), possibly in Rome from 1766 and in London from 1768. At the Royal Academy Schools from 1769, Hamilton developed into a figure painter and exhibited portraits and subject pictures at the Royal Academy from 1774 to 1801. He became ARA in 1784 and RA in 1789. Hamilton's most interesting work pertains to the theatre, particularly Shakespearean. His most distinguished large pictures are the 23 he painted for John Boydell's Shakespeare Gallery. Also in the 1790s he contributed illustrations to Bowyer's History of England and Thomas Macklin's Bible and British Poets. Nevertheless, his pleasantly plump and youthful figures were better suited to the less pretentious format of book illustration than that of history painting. His attractive romantic scenes appear in many editions of 18th-century poets as well as in John Bell's second editions of Shakespeare (1786-88) and The British Theatre (1791-97). Hamilton was capable of being an accomplished draughtsman in a variety of styles; his album of drawings (London, Victoria and Albert Museum) includes work reminiscent of Henry Fuseli and Angelica Kauffmann as well as more distinctive compositions nervously constructed with repeated, scratchy strokes of the pen. His portraits are mostly theatrical and include many of Sarah Siddons; they are curiously stilted, although the John Philip Kemble as Richard III (exhibited at the Royal Academy 1788; private collection) is a fine dramatic pastiche of Hogarth's portrait of David Garrick in the same role (1745; Liverpool, Walker Art Gallery).

34988,Winslow Homer,1836,1910,"American painter, illustrator and etcher. He was born in Boston, where he later worked as a lithographer and illustrator. In 1861 he was sent to the Civil War battlefront as correspondent for Harper's Weekly, his work winning international acclaim. Many of his studies of everyday life, such as Snap the Whip (1872, Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York), date from the postwar period, during which he was a popular magazine illustrator. In 1876, Homer abandoned illustration to devote himself to painting. He found his inspiration in the American scene and, eventually, in the sea, which he painted at Prouts Neck, Maine, in the summer and in Key West, Fla., or the Bahamas in the winter. After 1884 he lived the life of a recluse. Although Homer excelled above all as a watercolourist, his oils and watercolours alike are characterized by directness, realism, objectivity, and splendid colour. His powerful and dramatic interpretations of the sea in watercolour have never been surpassed and hold a unique place in American art. They are in leading museums throughout the United States. Characteristic watercolours are Breaking Storm and Maine Coast (both: Art Institute of Chicago) and The Hurricane (Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York). Characteristic oils include The Gulf Stream (1899) and Moonlight-Wood's Island Light (both: Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York.) and Eight Bells (1886; Addison Gallery, Andover, Mass.). Homer was one of the two most admired American late 19th-century artists (the other being Thomas Eakins) and is considered to be the greatest pictorial poet of outdoor life in the USA and its greatest watercolourist. Nominally a landscape painter, in a sense carrying on Hudson River school attitudes, Homer was an artist of power and individuality whose images are metaphors for the relationship of Man and Nature. A careful observer of visual reality, he was at the same time alive to the purely physical properties of pigment and colour, of line and form, and of the patterns they create. His work is characterized by bold, fluid brushwork, strong draughtsmanship and composition, and particularly by a lack of sentimentality. "

34571,William Edward Frost,1810,1877,"English painter, a follower of William Etty, and like him, was one of the few painters in England to dedicate himself to the nude. He was encouraged by his parents to take up painting after showing an early talent for art. He was put to study under a local artist, a Miss Evatt, and at age 15 was introduced to Etty, by whose advice he was sent to Sass's School in Bloomsbury. After three years there, he entered the Royal Academy Schools in 1829. He established himself as a portrait painter, working at a pace that gave rise to some 300 completed pictures over the next 14 years. It was only in 1843 that he first started to exhibit the figural compositions that were to dominate his art henceforth. In that year he showed a Bacchanalian Dance, following this successful picture with a range of nymphs, sirens, goddesses - anything without clothes. The scale was from large, crowded narrative pictures - Chastity, Pan and Dancing Nymphs etc - through to miniatures, of which he painted a large number. In 1845 he painted a Sabrina, which when exhibited at the Royal Academy gave rise to extreme approval, and he was elected Associate of the Royal Academy in the following year, as well as winning the patronage of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert. Despite the general prudishness and sexual repression of the Victorian era, Frost's relatively chaste nudes were popular, and his career was financially successful. Frost's creations became extremely popular in the form of prints and engravings, and some of them were reproduced in this way many times. He was elected full Academician only in 1871. "

As he displayed a precocious talent for drawing he was admitted to the preparatory class of the Kungliga Akademien för de Fria Konsterna, Stockholm, at the age of 15. Dissatisfied with the outdated teaching and discipline of the Academy and encouraged by his early success as a painter of watercolour portraits and genre scenes (e.g. Old Woman from Mora, 1879; Mora, Zornmuseum). Zorn left the Academy in 1881 to try to establish an international career. He later resided mainly in London but also travelled extensively in Italy, France, Spain, Algeria and the Balkans and visited Constantinople. However, he continued to spend most of his summers in Sweden. While his early works were often brilliant, luminous watercolours, by 1887 he had switched firmly to oils. Zorn painted portraits, scenes depicting rustic life and customs. He is also famous for his nude paintings and realistic depictions of water. It was primarily his skill as a portrait painter that gained Zorn international acclaim based principally upon his incisive ability to depict the individual character of his model. His subjects included three American Presidents. "

28381,Francis Wheatley,1747,1801,"English painter. He trained at William Shipley's Academy in London. In 1762, 1763 and 1765 he won prizes for drawing from the Society of Artists, and in 1769 he enrolled in the newly established Royal Academy Schools. He is recorded as having studied under a Mr Wilson in 1762; this may have been the portrait painter Benjamin Wilson or, less likely, the landscape painter Richard Wilson. Wheatley was abroad in 1763, probably in the Low Countries and France, and in 1766 he made his first trip to Ireland. He was elected a Fellow of the Society of Artists in 1770 and became a director in 1774. He worked as an assistant to the Royal Academician John Hamilton Mortimer in painting the Saloon ceiling at Brocket Hall in 1771-1773, and always acknowledged the profound debt he owed to his distinguished teacher. He exhibited pictures himself at the Society of Artists from 1765-1777. From 1778 onwards he exhibited regularly at the annual exhibition of the Royal Academy, being made as Associate (ARA) in 1790 and a full member (RA) the following year. Wheatley seems to have been incompetent with money, and was frequently in debt, despite numerous commissions. He moved from London to Dublin to escape his debtors (and a cuckolded irate husband) from 1779 to 1783, and painted numerous highly accomplished paintings whilst there. His masterpiece of these years is the remarkable The Irish House of Commons, 1780, now in the City Art Gallery, Leeds, which depicts a vast series of faithful portraits of all the Members of Parliament in Dublin. Wheatley was a versatile painter, executing straightforward portraits, conversation pieces, domestic and sentimental genre paintings and theatrical illustrations. He seems to have taken a particular interest in the depiction of rural life from the 1780's onwards. Wheatley at his best shows a remarkably fluidity and freedom of expression in his oil paintings, though his drawings are much more tightly controlled. Along with George Morland, he is the most accomplished English painter of the Rural Scene of his date; his range, though, is much wider than that of Morland, and some of his conversation pieces, for instance, rank with those of his friend and fellow-academician Johann Zoffany. About 1793 the artist began to suffer from a debilitating attack of gout, which ultimately rendered him a cripple, virtually unable to hold a paint brush. The last few years of his life saw a distressing descent into poverty, though he was frequently helped by his fellow Royal Academicians. He was ultimately forced into the Debtors' Prison of The King's Bench. By the time of his death at the age of 54, he was an emaciated and wasted figure, incapable of caring for his wife and family of four children. "

15105,Georg Lemberger,1495,1540,"German painter and woodcut designer. His main achievement was to introduce the painting principles of the Danube school to Middle Germany; he worked largely in Protestant context. Between 1513 and 1515 Lemberger may have joined Altdorfer in Regensburg and collaborated on the miniatures in the Triumphal Procession of Emperor Maximilian I (Vienna, Albertina). He may also have visited Wolf Huber in Passau at that time. He moved to Leipzig in 1520. The few known paintings by Lemberger are clearly linked, in their luxuriant depiction of landscape, to the Danube school and show an unusual liking for decorative detail. Lemberger's talent as a draughtsman is apparent in his paintings, an even more crucial in his woodcuts. In Leipzig and Magdeburg he became one of the most important book illuminators in his period. "

In 1541, Serlio moved to France, where he was appointed consultant for the architecture and decoration of the castle Fontainebleau and for the king's other castles. His only complete buildings were executed in France. Serlio was the author of the highly influential ""L'archittetura,"" published posthumously in 1584, one of the first architectural treatises in a modern language that was printed with illustrations in sixteenth-century Europe.

2982,Edme Bouchardon,1698,1762,"French sculptor, whose work marks the beginning of the Neoclassical reaction against the Rococo style. From 1723 to 1732 he worked in Rome, where he made a marble bust of the antiquarian Philippe Stosch (Staatliche Museen, Berlin, 1727) that is very consciously in the antique manner. Although his style later softened somewhat, notably in the famous Cupid Making a Bow from Hercules' Club (Louvre, Paris, 1750), it remained too severe for court taste. Bouchardon had many supporters, however, and his contemporary reputation stood high - indeed he was generally regarded as the greatest French sculptor of his time (subsequent taste has inclined more towards artists with greater warmth, such as Falconet and Pigalle). His most important work was an equestrian statue of Louis XV, commissioned by the City of Paris in 1748. It was cast in 1758 but not erected until 1763, a year after Bouchardon's death. It stood in the Place Louis XV (later the Place de la Concorede) and was destroyed during the Revolution. Several small copies exist, as well as emgravings, showing that it was based on the famous antique statue of Marcus Aurelius in Rome. Bouchardon's father, Jean-Baptiste (1667-1742), and his brother, Jacques-Philippe (1711-1753), were also sculptors. "

64601,Jean Poyet,,,"French illuminator. Poyet, who lived in Tours, France, was active from at least 1483 until his death around 1503. He was a multitalented artist - illuminator, painter, draftsman, and designer of festivals - who worked for the courts of three successive French kings: Louis XI (r. 1461-83), Charles VIII (r. 1483-98), and Louis XII (r. 1498-1515). Tours was the seat of the French court and centre of the Loire school of illumination during the latter part of the 15th century. Poyet was presumably related to Mathelin (or Maturin) Poyet, who is listed as a court painter alongside Jean Fouquet in 1475. Jean Poyet is first mentioned in 1483, and in December 1491 he was among local artists paid for their work on the decorations provided to celebrate the ceremonial entry into Tours of Anne of Brittany as Queen of Charles VIII of France. In August 1497 the Queen's accounts show that Poyet was paid 153 livres tournois to illuminate a 'petites heures' for her use. For this he provided 23 miniatures and almost 300 borders. It was thought that this identified him as the artist of the famous Hours of Anne of Brittany (Bibliothèque Nationale, Paris, Ms. lat. 9474), until the discovery in 1868 of the document that definitely connects Jean Bourdichon with the manuscript. His mastery of perspective, subtle use of colour and light, and convincing representation of the human figure show a break from the Late Gothic style. Influences of Renaissance paintings are noticeable: Poyet traveled to Italy and experienced the works of artists such as Andrea Mantegna and Giovanni Bellini. Payment documents tell us that for Louis XI's queen, Charlotte of Savoy, Poyet painted 1,031 coats of arms to be attached to the candles and torches used at her funeral. For Charles VIII he painted a schoolbook, a treatise on the Apostles' Creed, and his portrait. In August 1497 the Queen's accounts show that Poyet was paid 153 livres tournois to illuminate a 'petites heures' for her use. For this he provided 23 miniatures and almost 300 borders. It was thought that this identified him as the artist of the famous Hours of Anne of Brittany (Bibliothèque Nationale, Paris, Ms. lat. 9474), until the discovery in 1868 of the document that definitely connects Jean Bourdichon with the manuscript. For Charles and Anne's ceremonial entry into Tours following their marriage, Poyet designed and supervised elaborate theatrical spectacles as part of the royal entertainment. For Louis XII, Poyet was in charge of the pageants that Tours was planning in 1498. The artist's early period, in the 1480s, reveals his mastery of perspective, subtle use of colour and light, and convincing representation of the human figure in space. His monumental approach is typical of the Renaissance and represents a break from the Late Gothic style of the previous generation of French illuminators. The defining difference is his firsthand experience of the works of Italian Renaissance painting. Poyet's mature period began in the 1490s and lasted until his death around 1503; during these years he was most productive and at the peak of his career. He began to use a lighter, more pastel palette, applying his colours with feathery, almost impressionistic, brushstrokes. Like many major artists of the late Middle Ages and Renaissance, Poyet did not work alone but managed a workshop. Judging from the relatively few manuscripts they produced, however, his assistants were limited in number, for Poyet apparently hired only those illuminators capable of emulating his subtle style. Poyet's work seems to have been highly regarded in his own time. His name is included in the lists of famous painters given by Jean Lemaire in La Plaincte du Désiré (Lyon, 1504) and by Jean Pélerin in De artificiali perspectiva (Toul, 1505). Half a century later his artistic skills were rated above those of Fouquet and his two sons by Jean Breche of Tours in De rerum et verborum significatione (Paris, 1554). "

41236,Nicolas Vleughels,1668,1737,"French painter of Flemish origin. He trained with his father Philippe Vleughels (1620-94), a Flemish painter who had moved to Paris in 1642; he was also a pupil of Pierre Mignard I. In 1694 he came second in the Prix de Rome competition with Lot and his Daughters Leaving Sodom (untraced); despite repeated attempts, he failed to win the first prize. He became a close friend of Watteau and was, like him, greatly influenced by Flemish painting, notably that of Rubens. In 1704 Vleughels travelled to Italy at his own expense. From his base in Rome he made trips to Venice (1707-09) and Modena (1712-14) and was much influenced by the work of the Venetian colourists, particularly Veronese, whose works he copied (drawings in the Musée du Louvre, Paris). In 1716, back in Paris, he was approved (agréé) by the Académie Royale and in the same year was received (reçu) on presentation of Apelles Painting Campaspe (Musée du Louvre, Paris) as his morceau de réception. The influence of Veronese can be seen in the preparatory studies in oil and pastel for his paintings of this period, such as the  Studies of a Woman's Legs (Musée du Louvre, Paris) for the figure of Campaspe. His close relationship to Watteau's fètes galantes can be seen in the Abduction of Helen (c. 1716; private collection). From 1724 until his death he was director of the French Academy in Rome. "
34336,Asher Brown Durand,1796,1886,"American painter and engraver. He played a leading role in formulating both the theory and practice of mid-19th-century American landscape painting and was a central member of the Hudson River School. Five years older than Thomas Cole, he matured considerably later as an artist. After an apprenticeship (1812-17) with Peter Maverick, he began his career as an engraver, attaining eminence with plates after John Trumbull's Declaration of Independence (1820-23) and John Vanderlyn's Ariadne (1835), the latter so accomplished that the chronicler William Dunlap claimed it would win Durand immortality as an engraver. As with many contemporary artists, his training was based on drawing, an experience that influenced his insistence on the importance of outline and precise rendering. After 1835, Durand devoted himself to painting, producing portraits of several of the Presidents. After a year of travel and study in Europe, he turned to landscape painting, becoming a leader of the Hudson River school. At first he was painstaking and meticulous, but later his rendering became more spontaneous. Examples of his work are In the Woods and The Beeches (Metropolitan Museum); Woodland Brook and Franconia Notch (New York Public Library); and Mountain Forest (Corcoran Gallery). Durand was a founder of the National Academy of Design, New York City, and its president from 1845 to 1861. Two of his allegorical paintings are there, Morning of Life and Evening of Life. "

1992,Peter Behrens,1868,1940,"German architect, designer and painter. He studied painting and architecture in Hamburg, Düsseldorf and Karlsruhe. Inspired by the emerging Art Nouveau style, he first worked as a painter, illustrator and book-binder. Behrens was one of the founder-members of the Munich Secession in 1893 and, shortly afterwards, a founder of the more progressive Freie Vereinigung Münchener Künstler. Behrens regularly exhibited paintings and woodcuts in the 1890s (e.g. The Kiss, 1899; Museum of Art, Philadelphia). At the end of the decade, he decided to abandon painting in favour of the applied arts. His first graphic works and designs for glass, porcelain, jewellery and furniture appeared in 1898 and 1899. In 1899, he became a member of the artist colony in Darmstadt, built there his own house, and designed all decorative elements inside (furniture, paintings, pottery, tableware). He left the artistic circles of Munich, moved away from the exuberance of Jugendstil and began to produce more sober and austere designs. Behrens developed an elegant geometric, functional style that was between Jugendstil and Industrial Classicism, forecasting the Modernism movement that would emerge later on in Germany. In 1902, Behrens designed the much-appreciated entrance for the German pavilion at the Turin Exhibition; in 1903, he was named director of the Kunstgewerberschule in Düsseldorf. In 1907, Behrens created the Deutscher Werkbund (DWB), together with various companies, designers and architects. The Werkbund was influenced by the Arts and Crafts movement, and they began to develop similar innovative ideas on artworks, industry, social changes, economy and culture. In 1907, Behrens was called to Berlin as artistic adviser to AEG (Allgemeine Elektricitäts-Gesellschaft), and from this time, his work shows the marked influence of Prussian classicism. For AEG, he built factories and workers' housing, created the company's corporate identity by designing its trademark, stationery, catalogues and products. He began using new building techniques and new materials such as concrete, bricks, exterior steel supports and glass. Behrens’s contract with AEG also left him free to work on other commissions, and in 1910-11 he was involved in several major schemes, including the German Embassy at St Petersburg, the administration building of the Mannesmann Röhren-Werke in Düsseldorf and the Continentale-Gummi-Werke in Hannover. After World War I, Behrens completely reassessed his architectural language and abandoned the stereometric rationality and the classicism of his pre-war work. The I. G. Farben dye-works (1920-24) at Hoechst was the most impressive product of his Expressionist phase. In 1922, he taught at the Akademie der Bildenden Kuenste in Vienna and in 1936, he became the director of the Architecture Department of the Prussian Academy of Fine Arts in Berlin. He joined the Nazi Party and later worked on Hitler's plans for redesigning Berlin. "
5482,Noël Coypel,1628,1707,"French painter. He trained with an unknown painter in Orléans and in the studio of Noël Quillerier (1594-1669) in Paris. From the age of 18 Coypel collaborated with Charles Errard le fils, who was considered the most important designer of decorative schemes in Paris, until Errard was appointed director of the Académie de France in Rome in 1666. Collaboration with him gave Coypel the opportunity to take part in large projects. His first commission, a contribution to the stage scenery for Luigi Rossi's opera Orfeo, has not survived, but his second work, carried out under Errard's direction, gives an idea of the nature of his style. This is the ceiling painting in the Grande Chambre of the Palais du Parlement in Rennes (now the Palais de Justice), which was executed in 1663. As was his usual practice, Errard designed the general structure and individual decorative forms, entrusting Coypel with the task of painting. The detailed iconography of the nine painted compartments of the ceiling, which vary in dimension, is not clear in every case: most of the problematic figures are probably personifications of political virtues, which Coypel, in his distinctive way, represented without foreshortening or change in proportion. The figures, extremely plastic in conception and classicising in the manner of Poussin, appear parallel to the picture plane, with no concession to the spectator's viewpoint. Two small panels contemporary with the ceiling in Rennes, a Visitation and an Adoration of the Shepherds (both Paris, Hôpital Laennec, Chapel), likewise demonstrate why Coypel was justly called 'Coypel le Poussin' by connoisseurs of his time. Both representations have a friezelike composition; the classically modelled figures have moderate, albeit differentiated expressions. An earlier painting of St James the Greater Led to Execution (1661; Paris, Louvre), commissioned from Coypel for Notre-Dame de Paris by the Goldsmiths' Corporation, shows Poussin's influence in the overall composition and background architecture, as well as in the types of the individual figures. In 1672 he was appointed director of the French Academy at Rome. After four years he returned to France; and not long after he became director of the Academy of Painting. His sons Antoine and Noël-Nicolas were also painters. "

54034,Guy François,1573,1650,"French painter. He was known to be in Rome as early as 1608 and to be back in his native Puy-de-Dôme by 1613. He seems to have spent the rest of his long career in and around Le Puy, with an undocumented visit to Toulouse at an indeterminate date, probably in the 1620s. Most of the artist's pictures remain in the obscurity of the parish churches for which they were painted, and it is clear that he had ceased to experiment by about 1630. One of his most important pictures is at Bourg-en-Brese, the large altarpiece The Holy Family with St Bruno and St Elisabeth of 1626, which shows the artist's careful assimilation of the style of the Roman painter Carlo Saraceni. There is now a dispute as to whether some pictures are by Saraceni or Guy François, notably the Holy Family in the Wadsworth Athenaeum Hartford, which seems characteristic of both artists. Unlike Tournier, François never showed any passion in his art; his pictures always retained a Saracenesque smoothness and elegance. "

He trained under his grandfather, Thiry de Bry the Elder (d. 1528), and under his father, Thiry de Bry the Younger (1495-1590), who were jewelers and engravers, engraving copper plates. De Bry fled the Spanish persecution of Flemish Protestants and lived in Strassburg (Strasbourg) from 1570 to 1578 and then in Frankfurt am Main, where he established an engraving and publishing business. He twice visited London, where he executed such works as 12 plates for The Procession of the Knights of the Garter and another 34 plates for The Funeral of Sir Philip Sydney. He met the English geographer Richard Hakluyt, with whose assistance he collected materials for a finely illustrated collection of accounts of voyages and travels, Collectiones peregrinationum in Indiam orientalem et Indiam occidentalem (1590-1634; ""Collected Travels in the East Indies and West Indies""), which was continued by his sons Johann Theodor de Bry (1561-1623) and Johann Israel de Bry (died c. 1611) but not completed until 1634 by Matthäus Merian the Elder (1593-1650). Among other works that the elder de Bry engraved is a set of plates illustrating Thomas Harriot's A Briefe and True Report of the New Found Land of Virginia (1595) about the first English settlements in North America (in modern-day North Carolina). His illustrations were based on the watercolour paintings of colonist John White. De Bry created a large number of engraved illustrations for his books. Most of his books were based on first-hand observations by explorers, even if De Bry himself, acting as a recorder of information, never visited the Americas. To modern eyes, many of the illustrations seem formal but detailed. "

Schwind represents the tail-end of Germanic Romanticism and his most characteristic works depict an idealized fairy-tale Middle Ages, with knights in armour, damsels in distress, enchanted woods and castles, and much loving depiction of costume, architecture, etc. He was at his best working on a small scale, as in his numerous book illustrations and his woodcuts for Fliegende Blotter, a humorous Munich periodical. In his young days Schwind, who was an accomplished violinist, had been friendly with Franz Schubert and late in his own life he depicted Schubert's Vienna circle in a number of drawings. "

41723,Pirro Ligorio,1490,1583,"Italian architect, garden designer and painter. He was also an antiquarian and published several books on Roman antiquities. His most famous projects, the Villa d'Este at Tivoli (1560-69) combined all these interests. In September 1550, before his employment at the Vatican and during his study of classical antiquity, Ligorio was hired by the Cardinal of Ferrara (Ippolito II d'Este) to accompany him to Tivoli. There, while the Cardinal served as governor, Ligorio managed his antique collection and served as a top advisor. The villa, which still stands in its original state, has a planted landscape and a vast terraced garden with spectacular fountains leading up to the huge house. Ligorio also built the Casino of Pope Pius IV (Casina di Pio IV) in the Vatican Gardens (1558-62) and the Rotunda with Baldassare Peruzzi. He decorated his works with profuse stucco ornament; the Casino is a good example of his decoration. Ligorio also published a work on Roman antiquities and compiled an influential collection of Roman inscriptions, many of which were later found to be fraudulent. "

54872,Albert Dubois-Pillet,1845,1890,"French painter and army officer. (His real name: Albert Dubois.) He pursued a military career at the Ecole Impériale Militaire at Saint-Cyr, from which he graduated in 1867. He fought in the Franco-Prussian War (1870-71) and was held prisoner in Westphalia by the Germans; upon release he joined the Versailles army and participated in the suppression of the Commune. Following various assignments in the provinces, in late 1879 he was appointed to the Légion de la Garde Républicaine in Paris. Dubois-Pillet was a  self-taught amateur painter, closely aligned with the Neo-Impressionists. Though not formally trained, various Salons accepted his still-lifes for display as early as 1877. In 1884 he was the organizer and first president of the Société des artistes indépendants, where a Naturalist painting influenced by Manet caused a furious debate. Encouraged by Seurat, he subsequently began to paint pointillist landscapes, open-air genre scenes and portraits. Dubois-Pillet exhibited regularly with the Indépendants until 1889, and the only one-man exhibition of his work held in his lifetime took place at the Revue Indépendent in 1888. In 1888 and 1890 he exhibited with Les XX in Brussels. In an effort to camouflage his artistic activities from his military career, in 1884 he began to sign works of art ""Dubois"" with the addition of his mother's maiden name, ""Pillet."" Though the military forbade him from participating in art exhibitions in 1886, he remained active until his death. Perhaps because of this defiance, in 1889 he was posted to Le Puy in south central France as commander of the local gendarmerie. He died there during a smallpox outbreak in 1890. "

He studied under Pieter Brueghel the Younger, and afterward under Hendrik van Balen. He visited Italy in 1608. In 1611 he married Margaretha de Vos, the sister of the Flemish painters Cornelis and Paul de Vos. Snyders originally devoted himself to painting flowers, fruit, and still-life subjects, later turning to his lively depictions of animals. The compositions of these scenes of hunting and animals fighting are rich and varied. His drawing is accurate and vigorous, and his touch bold and thoroughly expressive of the different textures of furs and skins. Rubens frequently employed him to paint animals, fruit, and still-life objects in his own pictures. Snyders was appointed principal painter to the archduke Albert, governor of the Low Countries, for whom he executed some of his finest works. One of these, a ""Stag Hunt,"" was presented to Philip III of Spain, who commissioned the artist to paint several subjects of the chase. "

40759,Augustus Welby Northmore Pugin,1812,1852,"Augustus Welby Northmore Pugin, usually A.W.N. Pugin, was an English architect, designer, author, theorist, part of a family of architects. He was a leading figure in the English Roman Catholic and Gothic revivals. Pugin was the son of the architect Augustus Charles Pugin, who gave him his architectural and draftsmanship training. His mature professional life began in 1836 when he published Contrasts, which conveyed the argument with which Pugin was throughout his life to be identified, the link between the quality and character of a society with the calibre of its architecture. Pugin, who became a Roman Catholic in 1835, contended that decline in the arts was a result of a spiritual decline occasioned by the Reformation. Between 1837 and 1840 Pugin enjoyed a growing architectural practice. His employment by John Talbot, Earl of Shrewsbury, and other Roman Catholic laymen and clergy resulted in his identification with the leadership of the Roman Catholic revival. His plans for St. Chad's Cathedral, Birmingham, and St. George's Cathedral, Southwark, suffered from the limited funds available for their construction, but they nevertheless show his imaginativeness and brilliance. The Church of St. Oswald, Old Swan, Liverpool (1839; demolished), was the finest of his designs of these years and the one that set the pattern for Gothic revival parish churches in England and abroad. His True Principles of Pointed or Christian Architecture (1841) was used by John Ruskin as a foundation for his criticism. Pugin reached the height of his influence between 1840 and 1844: his theoretical position on the need for a revival of Gothic was refined and expressed with a literary skill equal to his powers as an architectural caricaturist and illustrator; and his circle of patrons loyally supported him. From these years come Pugin's splendid drawings for Balliol College, Oxford (1843), which convey the excitement and fervour of the Oxford Movement; the richly brilliant St. Giles, Cheadle, Staffordshire (1841-46); and extensive repairs and additions to Alton Towers, Staffordshire. Pugin's last major works are his own house, The Grange, and St. Augustine's Church, both at Ramsgate, Kent. The Rolle family chapel at Bicton, Devon, the decorations of the House of Lords, and the chapel at St. Edmund's College, Old Hall Green, Hertfordshire, well represent the elegant, erudite, yet original Gothic of which he was capable. The death of his second wife in 1844 and the recurrence of an old illness cast a shadow over Pugin's last years. His practice declined as other architects emerged to serve Roman Catholic clients. During his last years he worked with Sir Charles Barry on the new Palace of Westminster. His three sons, Edward Welby, Peter Paul (1851-1904), and Cuthbert Welby (1840-1928), were also architects. "

In 1866 he entered the École des Beaux-Arts, where he studied under Jean François Brémond (1807-1868) and Alexandre Cabanel. His Salon début in 1868 and his subsequent entries were well received, and in 1874 he won the Prix de Rome with the Death of Timophanes, Tyrant of Corinth (École Normale Supérieure des Beaux-Arts, Paris). Remaining in Italy for five years, Besnard worked in an academic style influenced by Pietro da Cortona and Michelangelo. He married to the daughter of the sculptor Dubray. He stayed in London for two years, where he studied Reynolds, Gainsborough, Lawrence, and the Pre-Raphaelites. Returning to Paris he very quickly became an immensely successful portrait painter working in pastels. In 1893 he traveled in Algeria, in 1906 in India. He became director of the École des Beaux-Arts, and in 1924 the fist painter accepted into the Académie Française. "

Most of his career was spent in The Hague, where he settled in 1661/62, but he trained in Deventer with Terborch. From his master he took his predilection for depicting costly materials - particularly white satin. He painted genre scenes and some religious and mythological subjects, but from about 1670 he devoted himself almost exclusively to portraits, often for court circles in The Hague. His reputation was such that Charles II invited him to England. His work, elegant, Frenchified, small in scale, and exquisitely finished, influenced Dutch portraiture into the 18th century, his followers including his sons Constantijn and Theodor (1661-1732)."

He probably received his initial training from his father, but was influenced at an early stage by Pordenone's Cremonese works, and also by Titian, whom he evidently came to know during his long sojourn in Venice (documented until 1525). His earliest known works show these influences and that of contemporary Brescian painters. They include the Virgin and Saints altarpiece from S Maria del Cistello (1527; Prague, National Gallery), the imposing organ shutters of David and Saul from S Maria di Campagna in Piacenza (1530; Piacenza, Museo Civico) and the Annunciation (Piacenza, S Maria di Campagna), which was cut down to fit the church's apse. These works show a remarkable maturity and originality in the use of colour and chiaroscuro to create illusionistic effects. "

40535,Agnolo Bronzino,1503,1572,"Florentine Mannerist painter (originally Agnolo di Cosimo), the pupil and adopted son of Pontormo, who introduced his portrait as a child into his painting Joseph in Egypt (National Gallery, London). The origin of his nickname is uncertain, but possibly derived from his having a dark complexion. Bronzino was deeply attached to Pontormo and his style was heavily indebted to his master. However, Bronzino lacked the emotional intensity that was such a characteristic of Pontormo's work and excelled as a portraitist rather than a religious painter. He was court painter to Duke Cosimo I de Medici for most of his career, and his work influenced the course of European court portraiture for a century. Cold, cultured, and unemotionally analytical, his portraits convey a sense of almost insolent assurance. Bronzino was also a poet, and his most personal portraits are perhaps those of other literary figures (Laura Battiferri, Palazzo Vecchio, Florence, c.1560). He was less successful as a religious painter, his lack of real feeling leading to empty, elegant posturing, as in The Martyrdom of S. Lorenzo (S. Lorenzo, Florence, 1569), in which almost every one of the extraordinarily contorted poses can be traced back to Raphael or to Michelangelo, whom Bronzino idolized. It is the type of work that got Mannerism a bad name. Bronzino's skill with the nude was better deployed in the celebrated Venus, Cupid, Folly, and Time (National Gallery, London), which conveys strong feelings or eroticism under the pretext of a moralizing allegory. His other major works include the design of a series of tapestries on The Story of Joseph for the Palazzo Vecchio. He was a much respected figure who took a prominent part in the activities of the Accademia del Disegno, of which he was a founder member in 1563. His pupils included Alessandro Allori, who - in a curious mirroring of his own early career - was also his adopted son. "

In c. 1654 all four moved to Paris to work for their uncle in his apartments in the Louvre and engrave his designs. On Jacques's death in 1657, Claudine, aged 21, took over the workshop, and was allowed to remain in the Louvre and continue her uncle's privilege. She was a pupil of her uncle. She engraved prints mainly after the paintings by Jacques Stella and Nicolas Poussin. "

About 1536 he went to Venice, where Titian employed him to execute the well-known copperplates of St Jerome in the Desert, the Magdalen, Prometheus, Diana and Actaeon, and Diana and Calisto. From Italy he wandered back to the Netherlands, but he returned to Venice soon after 1567, proceeding thence to Bologna and Rome, where he produced engravings from all the great masters of the time. In Rome he founded the well known school in which the simple line of Marcantonio Raimondi was modified by a brilliant touch of the burin, afterwards imitated and perfected by Agostino Carracci in Italy and Nicolaes de Bruyn in the Netherlands. In Italy, where he spent 12 years of his life, he was known as Cornelio Fiammingo. "

35835,George Morland,1763,1804,"English painter. He was an exponent of picturesque rustic genre painting who based himself on Dutch and Flemish 17-century models such as Brouwer or Teniers. Like them, he refused to work for individual patrons and preferred to sell through an agent, thus altering the whole basis of patronage in 18th-century England. His very numerous works were popularized through engravings, many of which were executed by William Ward, brother of James Ward, Morland's own brother-in-law, and imitator. The son of a painter, Henry Morland (c. 1730-1797), he exhibited drawings at the Royal Academy at the age of 10 (1773), and  his first oil painting was shown there in 1781. From then on he lived wildly, and in 1799 was arrested as a French spy while actually on the run from his creditors; after which he was in the King's Bench Prison until 1802. He died in prison after producing an enormous amount of scamped work to pay his debts. His reputation immediately declined and his place was taken by Wilkie. Among his most purely Dutch works are the Industry and Idleness (National Gallery of Scotland, Edinburgh), while the Stable (1791, National Gallery, London) is one of his best rustic subjects. "

40466,Alonso Cano,1601,1667,"Spanish sculptor, painter, architect, and draughtsman, sometimes called ""the Spanish Michelangelo"" because of the diversity of his talents. He was born and died in Granada, and worked there and in Seville and Madrid. His movements were partly dictated by his tempestuous character, for more than once he fled or was expelled from the city he was working in (once for the suspected murder of his wife). In spite of his violent temperament, his work tends to be serene and often sweet. He studied painting in Seville with Pacheco (Velázquez was his fellow-student) and sculpture with Montáñez, and stayed in the city from 1614 to 1638, when he moved to Madrid to become painter to the Count-Duke Olivares and was employed by Philip IV to restore pictures in the royal collection. Thus he became acquainted with the work of the 16th-century Venetian masters, whose influence is apparent in his later paintings; they are much softer in technique than his earlier pictures, which are strongly lit in the manner of Zurbarán. From 1652 he worked mainly in Granada, where he designed the façade of the cathedral (1667), one of the boldest and most original works of Spanish Baroque architecture. He was ordained a priest in 1658, as this was necessary for him to further his career at Granada Cathedral. The cathedral has several of Cano's works in painting and sculpture, including a polychrome wooden statue of the Immaculate Conception (1655) that is sometimes considered his masterpiece. "

44999,Hans Thoma,1839,1924,"German painter, printmaker and museum director. He was the son of a miller, craftsman and smallholder and studied briefly as a lithographer in Basel in 1854 before being apprenticed to a watchcase painter in Furtwangen. Returning home the same year, he started to draw and paint in his spare time. In 1859 he enrolled at the Kunstschule in Karlsruhe, where he studied until 1866 with Ludwig Des Coudres (1820-78) and the landscape painter Johann Wilhelm Schirmer (1807-1863), by whom he was especially influenced. He spent his summer vacations drawing and painting in Bernau, and his landscapes, portraits and genre pictures from this time record his transition from amateur painter to accomplished artist. His pictures of his mother and his sister Agathe, which he produced from c. 1864 onwards, show increasing similarities with the painterly realism of contemporary French painting (e.g. the double portrait of his Mother and Sister Reading the Bible, 1866; Kunsthalle, Karlsruhe). Thoma left the academy at the end of 1866 and went to Düsseldorf. There he met Otto Scholderer and went with him to Paris for several weeks in May 1868. Under Courbet's influence, he returned to Germany to paint pictures of figures and landscapes. In 1874 Thoma went to Italy for the first time and became acquainted with Hans von Marées in Rome. In 1882 Thoma received his first major commission, to paint five frescoes with scenes from Wagnerian operas in the house of the architect Simon Ravenstein in Frankfurt. In 1890 the first successful exhibition was mounted by the Munich Kunstverein and Thoma joined the Munich Secession. In 1899 Thoma was made director of a gallery in Karlsruhe and was appointed professor at the art academy there. Thoma's realistic landscapes, portraits, and scenes from country life, which are noted for their rich, full-bodied colour, are painted in a distinctive national romantic style. His later, individual style, modeled on that of old German woodcuts, shows rich colouring and depth of imaginative feeling. Typical examples include The Evening Hour (1868; Kunsthalle, Hamburg), Black Forest Landscape (1872; National Gallery, Berlin), and Self-portrait (1880; Picture Gallery, Dresden). His later symbolic religious pictures reveal the influence of Böcklin, especially in their use of fantastic elements and stylisation, for example, Adam and Eve (1897; the Hermitage, St. Petersburg). On his seventieth birthday, the Hans Thoma Museum was opened as an annex of the Karlsruhe Kunsthalle. "

Born in 1821 in Beaune to a Croatian father and French mother, he initially studied architecture at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Dijon until he was expelled in 1838 for unruly behaviour. In 1839 he left for Marseille, where he was Clerk of Works on the construction of the Marseille canal. In November 1839 he was noticed by Ferdinand Philippe, Duc d'Orléans, who accepted two watercolours that Ziem presented to him and commissioned a further six. This first success decided Ziem's vocation, and he started a drawing class that was attended by Louis Auguste Laurent Aiguier (1819-1865) and Adolphe Monticelli. During this period he also encountered the Provençal artists Emile Loubon (1809-1863), Prosper Grésy (1804-1874) and Gustave Ricard (1823-1873). As an artist, Ziem became an avid traveler in search of beautiful subjects, favouring areas with unique atmospheric qualities. He owned homes in Venice, the Martigues, Nice and Paris. In 1844 he traveled to Greece, Turkey and Russia, and would later travel through Belgium, Holland, England, Egypt, Hungary and Algeria. Throughout his career, Ziem was also an active exhibitor in the Paris Salons, beginning in 1849. "

After training in Naples with the landscape painter Goffredo Wals, in about 1614 Filippo Napoletano moved to Rome where he became a member of Agostino Tassi's workshop. Strongly influenced by Adam Elsheimer, Paul Bril and Tassi, Napoletano painted, according to Giulio Mancini, 'fires and boats' though no extant work can be securely assigned to his early years in Rome. From 1617 to 1621 he was active in Florence in the service of Grand Duke Cosimo II de' Medici, working closely with Jacques Callot. Besides the occasional religious and mythological subject, Napoletano produced landscapes and small scenes of everyday country life. During this time he was in close contact with the Dutch Italianate painters Cornelis van Poelenburgh and Bartholomeus Breenbergh, who also worked for the Medici. Soon after the death of Cosimo II in 1621, Napoletano returned to Rome, where he decorated the palace of Cardinal Guido Bentivoglio with landscape frescoes (1622-23, now Palazzo Pallavicini-Rospigliosi). He also supplied the Barberini tapestry manufactory with a series of cartoons depicting famous castles, including Fontainebleau, Grottaferrata and Castelgandolfo (1627, private collection). According to Giovanni Baglione, Napoletano was the first Italian artist to paint from nature at Tivoli. Soon after his election as 'principe' of the Accademia di San Luca in 1629, Napoletano fell ill and retired to Naples, where he died that same year. "

26608,Giovanni Battista Trotti,1555,1619,"Italian painter and architect, the last important exponent of Cremonese Mannerism. He was a pupil of Bernardino Campi and inherited his workshop. The cold, brilliant colours and enamel-like surfaces of Trotti's first recorded works, the Sacrifice of Melchidesek and the Gathering of Manna (both Pralboino Parish Church), closely follow Bernardino's style. More influential, however, were the works of Antonio Campi, seen, for example, in the detailed use of light in the Beheading of St John the Baptist (1590; Museo Civico ""Ala Ponzone"", Cremona), and especially Bernardino Gatti. From the latter Trotti derived the elements of Correggio's style that appear in his work from the early Annunciation (Santa Chiara, Casalmaggiore). First-hand knowledge of Correggio's work in Parma is reflected in the Nativity (1584; SS Ambrogio e Simpliciano, Carate Brianza). He also absorbed a special interest in landscape from the Flemish painters he met in Parma. He was employed by the court of Parma, along with Agostino Carracci; and Agostino found Trotti disagreeable on which account he acquired the name of II Malosso (bad bone). From 1587 he participated in the decoration of San Pietro al Po, Cremona. His busy workshop executed an impressive series of commissions in Cremona and the neighbouring regions, for example at Salò Cathedral (c. 1590) and San Sisto, Piacenza (1603). To cope with the enormous quantities required many of his designs were executed by pupils, but he signed the finished paintings. In the early 17th century he was employed as a painter, architect and interior designer by members of the Farnese family in Parma, for example on the decoration of the Palazzo del Giardino (now Palazzo Ducale), and was awarded the title Cavaliere. He often returned to Cremona, for example to work on the cathedral's altar of the Holy Sacrament, design decorations in honour of Philip III, King of Spain, and Margaret of Austria, and supervise his workshop, especially in the decoration of the Oratory of the Risen Christ in S Luca, Cremona.

As a young man he soldiered at Kassel in Germany and in Italy, where he fought for Savoy in the War of the Austrian Succession (1740-48). In 1752 he was elected to Geneva's Council of Two Hundred and served his native city as a magistrate. He had no formal artistic training, but from his youth he clipped out of paper or cards freehand profiles of a kind that later came to be called silhouettes. He also devised what he called tableaux en découpures, cut in vellum or parchment on the scale of large reproductive prints; these represented antique subjects, landscapes and genre scenes.  He is best known for his witty paintings, cut-out profiles, prints and drawings of the writer and thinker Voltaire. "

103164,Gerrit van Battem,1631,1684,"Dutch draughtsman, etcher and painter. He is usually judged by his many signed - and often highly coloured - gouache drawings of landscape views and genre scenes. However, several gouache drawings of religious subjects, for example the Crucifixion (Cleveland, OH, Museum of Art), have been suggested as early works. Between 1648 and 1654 he was very likely a pupil in Rotterdam of Abraham Furnerius, a relative (on his mother's side). In 1668 van Battem was in Utrecht, where he married Margaretha Scheffer, sister of the local painter Anton Scheffer. The same year he was commissioned by Philips Koninck, the brother-in-law of Abraham Furnerius (d. 1654), to arrange for the auction of the prints, drawings and art books belonging to the estate of Abraham's father, Dr Johannes Furnerius (d. 1668), a Rotterdam surgeon and collector. Van Battem must have seen the colourful landscapes of Herman Saftleven II while in Utrecht, where he lived until 1669, when he returned to Rotterdam. In 1678 he was paid by the municipal authorities of Rotterdam to restore a painting in the stock exchange. In the 1670s he worked with van Ruisdael, painting some of the figures in his famous landscapes. In his personal work, van Battem preferred to paint Dutch countrysides and towns, winter scenes, canals, and woodlands. "

36385,Richard Riemerschmid,1868,1957,"German designer, architect and painter. The son of a textile manufacturer, he studied painting at the Staatliche Kunstakademie in Munich (1888-90); he painted primarily at the beginning and end of his career and was a member of the Munich Secession. In 1895 Riemerschmid designed his first furniture, in a neo-Gothic style, for his and his wife's flat on Hildegardstrasse in Munich. In 1897 he exhibited furniture and paintings at the seventh Internationale Kunstausstellung held at the Glaspalast in Munich. Immediately following the exhibition, the committee members of the decorative arts section, including Riemerschmid and Hermann Obrist, founded the Vereinigte Werkstätten für Kunst im Handwerk. As a founder member of the German Werkbund (1907) and its president from 1921 to 1926, and through his activities as a teacher, and author of numerous ideological essays on art, Riemerschmid was one of the leading figures in German Jugendstil. His oeuvre includes interiors, furniture, glassware, stoneware, fabrics, and wallpapers, as well as buildings. The latter include the Munich Schauspielhaus (1900-01, interior), the Garden City of Hellerau near Dresden (1907-08, development plan), the Deutsche Werkstatte factory building in Dresden (1909) and the Bavarian Radio building in Munich (1928-29). "
108728,Cristoforo Cortese,,,"Italian illuminator. A pivotal figure in early 15th-century Venetian manuscript illumination, he was first mentioned as a 'miniator' in the Mariegola (rule book) of the Scuola di Santa Caterina dei Sacchi, Venice (Venice, Museo Correr, MS. IV, 118), written around the turn of the 15th century. A note indicating his paternity ('filio ser Marci') in a document of 1420 indicates that he was a brother of Franceschina, wife of Giovanni di Francia. The latter has been identified with Zanino di Pietro, a painter who influenced Cortese's style. In 1409 a Venetian document mentions a 'Christophorus de Cortisiis pictor', who may be the illuminator Cortese to whom the polyptych Virgin and Child with Four Saints in the parish church of Altidona, Ascoli Piceno, has been tentatively attributed. The polyptych is very close to the style of Zanino di Pietro and also to that of a diptych, the Crucifixion with SS Francis and Onofrio, in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. Other documents, dated 1420 and 1425, also mention the artist. In September 1425 Cortese was in Bologna, but in October he returned to Venice, where he is mentioned as still living in 1439. "
34642,Giorgio Ghisi,1520,1582,"Italian engraver. His teacher was probably Giovanni Battista Scultori, after whose designs and in whose style he engraved two Scenes from the Trojan War. His six earliest prints, from the early 1540s or before, are after designs by Giulio Romano. They are lightly engraved in rather flat perspective, the figures often silhouetted against dark backgrounds, the shading lines not necessarily defining volume, and with an effect of intense flickering light, in the style of Scultori. Ghisi is recorded as being with Giovanni Battista Bertani in Rome during the reign of Pope Paul III (1534-49). There he may have met Antoine Lafréry, who published four of his engravings during the 1540s, and many others throughout his life. Probably after his return from Rome he made an engraving on ten separate plates after Michelangelo's Last Judgement, his model probably being a drawing by Marcello Venusti. His 1550 visit to Antwerp made Ghisi an important link between Italian and northern engraving. Ghisi and most of his Italian contemporaries were reproductive engravers, working from the designs of other artists. "

Although Paul Bartlett was born in the United States he may well be considered a French sculptor since he spent the greater part of his life in Paris. He lived in Paris in his boyhood and studied at the École des Beaux-Arts and under Frémiet. The Bohemian Bear Trainer won a gold medal at the Salon of 1888. Of his other works, The Ghost Dance is at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts; the equestrian statue of Lafayette is in Paris and a replica is in Hartford, Conn.; Columbus, Michelangelo, and Law are in the Library of Congress. The bronze statue of Robert Morris (Philadelphia) was unveiled after the sculptor's death. Bartlett's masterwork was the House of Representatives pediment at the U.S. Capitol building, The Apotheosis of Democracy, begun in 1908 and completed in 1916. "

From 1625 to 1643 he worked for the Antwerp publishing house, Plantin-Moretus, producing ornamental initials, book illustrations, vignettes and similar book decorations. Jegher's woodcuts appear in the Plantin Missals of 1626, 1628 and 1632, and in the Breviaries of 1627, 1631, 1632, 1636 and 1642. He also completed nearly 50 woodcuts for Juan Eusebio Nieremberg's 'Historia naturae', published in 1635. Jegher made prints after designs by Peter Paul Rubens from about 1632 until 1640. Although Rubens had employed engravers to reproduce and propagate his designs from about 1609, he did not utilize woodcut until later. Jegher produced nine woodcuts, including two chiaroscuros, after his images. "

He was a landscape artist who is now mainly known for his Italianising and topographical drawings of sites throughout the Southern Netherlands. His subjects are either imaginary, idealised panoramas or topographical views of towns and villages. He created several etchings, sometimes after his drawings, He was possibly a pupil of Lucas van Uden, however, there is no documentary evidence for this. In 1647 he was registered in the Guild of Saint Luke in Antwerp as a master painter and engraver. In 1650 he spent some time in Dordrecht. From 1662 he is known to have been active in the Meuse valley around Namur and Huy where he made many studies of the landscapes. In 1665 he is registered as a poorter of Namur. He enjoyed the patronage of the local monasteries. He collaborated with Jacques Nicolai (1605-1678) who painted the figures in 18 landscapes commissioned by the convent of Croisiers in Namur. Around 1680, he returned to Antwerp where he died in 1687. "

20528,Giovanni Battista Piazzetta,1682,1754,"Venetian painter, son of Giacomo Piazzetta, a woodcarver, who studied under Giuseppe Maria Crespi in Bologna and was probably influenced by him to take up genre subjects. He settled in Venice by 1711, and after his death his family petitioned the State for a pension, claiming that his 'constant studies and his pursuit of glory rather than gain had reduced him to poverty and hastened his death'. His works are comparatively few, and though appearing to be executed with speed and facility were the product of careful deliberation and infinite pains. He made many drawings for collectors and as book-illustrations in order to support his family; his work was much influenced by Rembrandt's etchings and his paintings evolve from Baroque contrasts of chiaroscuro towards a freer and more fluid Rococo handling. Piazzetta's influence on the young Tiepolo was very great and it was Tiepolo who completed the transition to the Rococo. Most of his paintings are in Venice, including his only ceiling decoration, the Glory of S. Dominic, painted before 1727 (SS. Giovanni e Paolo). Other works are in Birmingham, Boston, Cambridge (Fitzwilliam), Cologne, Cortona (S. Filippo), Chicago, Cleveland Ohio, Detroit, Dresden, Dublin, Florence (Uffizi), Hartford Conn., London (National Gallery), Los Angeles, Milan (Brera), New York (Metropolitan Museum of Art), Padua, Paris (Louvre), Parma, Prague, Rome (Galleria Nazionale, Accademia di S. Luca), Springfield Mass., Stockholm, Vicenza, Washington (National Gallery of Art) and elsewhere. His drawings are well represented in the Royal Collection at Windsor Castle. "

His works were copied or imitated by Johan Christian Roedig (1751-1802), who may have been his pupil. "

41200,Jacopo Ligozzi,1547,1626,"Italian painter and draftsman, part of a large family of painters and artisans patronised by the Habsburg Imperial Family, who also executed commissions for the prince-bishop of Trento. His father was the artist Giovanni Ermanno Ligozzi. After a time in the Habsburg court in Vienna where he displayed drawings of animal and botanical specimens, he was invited to come to Florence, receiving the patronage of the Medici as one of the court artists. Upon the death of Giorgio Vasari in 1574, he became head of the Accademia del Disegno (now the Accademia di Belle Arti Firenze), the officially patronized guild of artists. Ligozzi was made capomaestro (chief head) of the Florentine granducal artistic workshop, soprintendente della galleria (superintendent of the gallery), and first painter to the court. He served Francesco I, Ferdinando I, Cosimo II and Ferdinando II, Grand Dukes of Tuscany. Ligozzi became a specialist painter of plants and animals, which he managed to reproduce in so vivid a fashion they seemed quite almost life like. During his first ten years in Florence his time was principally devoted to this activity, but also included some of the interior decorations of the Tribuna degli Uffizi for which he also supplied in 1587 small groups of paintings. These included the Sacrifice of Isaac and the Female Strangler still in the Florentine public collections. He was also a portraitist. One of the most prolific artists of the 1600s in Florence, Jacopo Ligozzi signed many of his works with the title di minio, miniaturist, suggesting the importance he attached to his small-scale works.

40738,Giovanni Antonio Pellegrini,1675,1741,"Venetian decorative painter, who was a pupil of Sebastiano Ricci and one of the most important of Tiepolo's predecessors. Like Pittoni, he worked for many foreign patrons and travelled widely. He was first recorded as a painter in 1703 and soon after this he married the sister of Rosalba Carriera, who mentions him in her diary on several occasions. In 1707 Lord Manchester went on an embassy to Venice; he commissioned a picture to celebrate the event from Carlevaris and brought Pellegrini and Marco Ricci back to London with him in 1708. Pellegrini soon had considerable success and became a Director of Kneller's Academy in 1711. Vertue says that Pellegrini 'painted prodigious quick, had a very noble and fruitfull invention' which may be seen in the decorations at Kimbolton Castle (now a school), done for Lord Manchester, or in the decorations at Castle Howard (1709, mostly destroyed in 1941). In these decorative series Pellegrini shows that he was a true precursor of Tiepolo in the lightness and gaiety of his touch which contrasts with the duller history painting of Pittoni. In 1713 he went to Germany and Flanders; returning to England in 1719 when, according to Vertue, he was less successful because Marco Ricci had sent for his uncle Sebastiano, who was generally agreed to be a better painter. Pellegrini also painted a splendid ceiling for the Bank of France (since destroyed) in Paris, decorated the Great Hall in the Mauritshuis in The Hague (1718), and worked in Prague, Dresden and Vienna. There is a sketch of 1710 in London (Victoria and Albert Museum) which may represent his design for the cupola of St Paul's for which, according to Vertue, 'he made several designs and a moddle for painting the Cupolo at St Paul's for which he was paid tho' he had not the cupolo to paint'. There are works by him in Barnard Castle (Bowes Museum), Berlin, Birmingham, Boston, Cleveland Ohio, Dresden, Dublin, The Hague, Leeds, London (National Gallery), Oxford (Ashmolean), Paris (Louvre), Toledo Ohio, Vienna and elsewhere.

His work combines the high-keyed colours of the Rococo with poses derived from such artists as van Dyck, Kneller and his own teacher and father-in-law, Jonathan Richardson. He painted at least 400 portraits, about 80 of which were engraved. Among his many pupils were Joseph Wright of Derby, John Hamilton Mortimer and Joshua Reynolds. Hudson was a member of the group of artists including Hogarth, Allan Ramsay, Francis Hayman and the sculptor John Michael Rysbrack who met at Old Slaughter's Coffee House in the mid-1740s and who promoted Thomas Coram's Foundling Hospital, of which they were governors, as the first public exhibiting space for artists in London. From the mid 1740s to the mid 1550s he was the leading fashionable portraitist in London, rivalled only by Ramsay. He went into semi-retirement in the late 1750s, when his former pupil Reynolds was rapidly rising in success. "

Together with Max Liebermann and Lovis Corinth, Slevogt was among the principal exponents of German Impressionism and was influenced by Millet and Courbet. His father, adjutant and friend of the future Prince Regent, Luitpold (1821-1912), died when Slevogt was just two years old. His mother moved to Würzburg, where he spent his schooldays. Even in his childhood and adolescence, family connections brought Slevogt to Pfalz, to an aunt in Landau and to the Finkler family in Neukastel. Initially he had planned to become a musician, but he began to study painting at the Akademie der Bildenden Künste in Munich in 1885. His fellow students included Gabriel von Hackl (1843-1926), Karl Raupp (1837-1918), Ludwig Herterich (1856-1932) and Wilhelm von Diez (1839-1907). In 1889 he spent a term at the Académie Julian in Paris. At that time Impressionism had very little effect on him. Following a trip to Italy in 1890 with the painter Robert Breyer (1866-1941) who had befriended him at the Akademie, he began to work independently as a painter in Munich. In 1893 he participated in the first exhibition of the newly founded Munich Secession, exhibiting Wrestling School (1893; Edenkoben, Schloss Villa Ludwigshöhe); the judges wanted to refuse this painting as immoral since its entwined and naked men caused offence. In the following years his paintings often appeared harsh and non-academic to conservative Munich circles. At this time Slevogt also made contributions to the journals Jugend and Simplizissimus, which were significant in the development of his graphic work. In 1898 he married his childhood friend Antonie ('Nini') Finkler. In the same year he went to Neukastel and on an autumn trip to an exhibition in Amsterdam of Rembrandt's work with the art historian Karl Voll (1867-1917). Voll instructed him in the history of art and published the first monograph on him in 1912. In 1900 he traveled to the World Fair in Paris. In 1901 he stayed  in Frankfurt where he painted his famous brightly coloured zoo pictures. From 1901 he was in Berlin, working mainly as a portrait painter, and held a master class at the Academy. In 1914 he visited Egypt and painted landscapes in the bright sunlight. In 1915 went to Belgium as a war artist. After the was he lived in Neukastel in the Palatinate. In the 1920s he did 500 illustrations for an edition of Goethe's Faust. In 1924 he executed murals for the concert hall at Neukastel and in Berlin. He also did the stage design for Mozart's Don Giovanni at the Dresden Opera. "

44014,Edvard Munch,1863,1944,"Norwegian painter and lithographer, his country's greatest artist. He was concerned with the expressive representation of emotions and personal relationships in his work. He was associated with the international development of Symbolism during the 1890s and recognized as a major influence on Expressionism. His early work was conventionally naturalistic; by 1884, he belonged to the avant-garde circle of the painter Christian Krøhg, and was part of the world of bohemian artists in Christiana (now Oslo) who had advanced ideas on ethics and sexual morality. During his stays in Paris between 1889 and 1892 Munch was influenced by the symbolists, Vincent van Gogh, and, above all, Paul Gauguin; it was during this time that he established his characteristic nervous linear style. In 1892 he was invited to exhibit at the Kunstlerverein (Artists' Union) in Berlin and his work caused such an uproar in the press that the exhibition was closed after a week with the repercussions leading to the formation of the Berlin Sezession in 1899. The scandal made him famous overnight in Germany, so Munch moved there and from 1892 to 1908 lived mainly in Berlin with frequent stays in Norway and visits also to France and Italy. In Berlin, he was associated with writers such as Richard Dehmel and August Strindberg and created works featuring his recurrent themes of sexual awareness, illness, jealousy, and insanity. These intense and disturbing works reflected not only Symbolist preoccupations but Munch's difficulties stemming from his own traumatic childhood during which his mother and sister died and his father nearly went mad. While in Berlin he produced his first prints, with lithographs and woodcuts becoming equally important to his paintings. In the 1890s Munch dedicated himself to an ambitious multi-canvas series called The Frieze of Life. Though the series was never completed, the twenty-two canvases Munch did produce extended his obsessive exploration of sexuality and mortality. The Frieze of Life included Munch's iconic image of modern angst, The Scream; as with many of his paintings, he created several versions of it. Part of the series was translated by Munch into etching, lithography, or woodcut. The woodcuts (often in colour) are particularly impressive, exploiting the grain of the wood to contribute to their rough, intense vigour. In 1908 he suffered a nervous breakdown, the legacy of heavy drinking, overwork, and a wretched love affair. After the rehabilitation in 1909, he returned permanently to Norway, deliberately abandoning his disturbing themes as part of his recovery. He largely turned away from images of private despair and anguish and created more colourful, optimistic paintings. His work became more outgoing, his palette brighter, and his themes more optimistic although his self-portraits retained their earlier intensity. After 1916 Munch became increasingly reclusive and his work regained some of its earlier urgency. The great achievement of this period is a series of large oil paintings for the University Hall of Oslo (1910-15) exalting the positive forces of nature, science, and history. In 1916 he settled at Ekely, outside Oslo, thenceforth living a solitary life. At his death, he left over 20,000 works to the city of Oslo to create the Munch Museum. During Munch's lifetime, there were many exhibitions of his work in Oslo, Prague, Stockholm, and German cities. "

32942,Jan Toorop,1858,1928,"Dutch painter. He was born in Purworejo, Java, Dutch East Indies, in 1872, he moved with his family to the Netherlands. He took a course in drawing at the Polytechnische School in Delft (1876-79). He also studied at the Rijksakademie voor Beeldende Kunsten in Amsterdam (1880-82) and at the Ecole des Arts Décoratifs in Brussels (1882-85). In Amsterdam he joined the St Lukas Society, and in Belgium he was a founder-member of Les XX in 1884. Although he had met Jozef Israëls in 1880 and respected the style of the Hague School, he was more attracted by what he saw in Brussels, particularly work by French artists. His portraits of 1884 are painted in an Impressionist style. With other members of Les XX he trained himself in plein-air; he learnt from James Ensor how to apply colours with a palette knife and how to use white with the same intensity as other colours. His style, however, remained austere and his scenes of workmen show a sensitive realism reminiscent of Gustave Courbet's work. During his years in Brussels, Toorop worked in various styles, such as Realism, Impressionism, Neo-Impressionism and Post-Impressionism. After his marriage to an Annie Hall, a British woman, in 1886, Toorop alternated his time between The Hague, England and Brussels, and after 1890 also the Dutch seaside town of Katwijk aan Zee. During this period he developed his own unique Symbolist style, with dynamic, unpredictable lines based on Javanese motifs, highly stylised willowy figures, and curvilinear designs. Thereafter he turned to Art Nouveau styles, in which a similar play of lines is used for decorative purposes, without any apparent symbolic meaning. In 1905 he converted to Catholicism and began producing religious works. He also created book illustrations, posters, and stained glass designs. "

36901,Antonio Tempesta,1555,1630,"Italian painter, draughtsman and printmaker. Enrolled at the Accademia del Disegno in Florence on 8 December 1576, he was a pupil of Santi di Tito, then of Joannes Stradanus, with whom he worked under Giorgio Vasari on the interior decoration of the Palazzo Vecchio in Florence. He then went to Rome, where he again had links with artists from the Netherlands. He and Matthijs Bril were commissioned by Pope Gregory XIII to paint the Transfer of the Relics of St Gregory of Nazianzus (1572) and other religious scenes in the loggias on the third floor of the Vatican Palace. In Tempesta's frescoes in the Palazzina Gambara at the Villa Lante in Bagnaia (1578-09), the hunting and fishing scenes, sweeping landscapes and urban backdrops again reveal the influence of Netherlandish art. From 1579 to 1583 Tempesta participated in the decoration of the Palazzo Farnese in Caprarola, notably of the Scala Regia. He is also known to have collaborated on the frescoes in the Villa d'Este at Tivoli. His fresco decorations, precious little paintings on marble, and engravings are characterized by representative vivacity and high execution quality. Tempesta's most famous works are: Grotesques of Scala Regia (Palazzo Farnese, Caprarola), Triumph of Love and of Fame (Rome, Casino Rospigliosi), scenes of hunting, processions and battles (Palazzo Borghese, Palazzo Giustiniani, Casino Rospigliosi in Rome, Villa Lante in Viterbo), frieze dedicated to Charles V (Palazzo Antici-Mattei, Rome), a great map of Rome (Galleria Clementina, Vatican).

He studied in Copenhagen under Christoffer Wilhelm Eckersberg, in Dresden under Eduard Julius Bendemann (1811-1889), and in Paris under Thomas Couture. Frølich travelled extensively throughout Europe, spending time in Germany (1845-46), Italy (1846-51) and Paris (1851-75), as well as in Denmark (1854-57) and London (1870-71). The amalgam of artistic trends he encountered contributed to an eclectic and unique personal style that flourished most creatively through his works on paper. In addition to his talents in portraiture, Frølich was particularly skilled at plein-air landscape studies, such as his Large Oak in the Metropolitan Museum of Art. "
43944,Lorenzo Lippi,1606,1665,"Italian painter and poet. He was trained by Matteo Rosselli, with whom he worked for many years in close partnership. His collaboration was sometimes anonymous but is documented from 1622, when they decorated the ceiling of the Sala della Stufa (Florence, Palazzo Pitti), to 1631-32, when they worked together on lunettes portraying St Francis Adoring the Child and St Catherine in Prison (Florence, San Gaetano). In 1630 Lippi was enrolled in the Accademia del Disegno but appears not to have had his own workshop until after 1634, although he worked independently before then. The earliest paintings attributable to him are, both in facial types and in the soft, rich folds of the drapery, close in style to the work of Rosselli. Examples include canvases of the Apostles James, John and Matthew, and Christ Blessing (all 1628; Vaglia, San Pietro), and the Virgin Handing the Child to St Francis (1629; Florence, San Salvatore di Camaldoli). In the 1630s Lippi painted decorative and theatrical compositions, mainly on literary and biblical themes, which remained indebted to Rosselli, for example Samson and Delilah (1632; Stockholm, Nationalmuseum) and the Virgin in Glory with Saints (1634; Ronta, nr Barberino di Mugello, San Michele). Shortly afterwards he produced works (e.g. the Sacrifice of Isaac and Hagar and the Angel; both San Miniato, Museo Diocesano d'Arte Sacra), which, in their use of sfumato as a means of heightening the feeling of pathos, are reminiscent of the work of Francesco Furini.

He was a friend and contemporary of Rembrandt and a pupil of Lastman in Amsterdam. Then shared a studio with Rembrandt in Leiden in the later 1620s: many works of this period show one influencing the other. Lievens went to England, probably in 1632 after Rembrandt moved to Amsterdam, but he was in Antwerp by 1635, where he was influenced by the courtly style of Van Dyck. He returned to Holland in 1639 and became a successful painter of portraits and allegories. Raising of Lazarus is a good example of his works. "

He studied under his father Francesco, who was an engraver, his uncle Carlo Zucchi, a scene painter, Francesco Fontebasso, and Jacopo Amigoni. In his early works he imitated Amigoni's manner and hazy style of colouring. His earliest works were historical pictures in oils, and the church of San Jacopo at Venice possesses an altarpiece by him, but he subsequently devoted himself chiefly to landscape and decorative work. In 1754 he accompanied Robert Adam (1728-1792) and Charles Louis Clérisseau in their travels through Italy and Dalmatia, sketching architectural remains, and some of his drawings were engraved in Adam's 'Ruins of the Palace of Diocletian at Spalatro,' 1764. In Italy, he would have gained a deeper knowledge of the Neo-classical style. In 1766 Zucchi was invited to England by Adam, who employed him on the interior decorations of many of the great mansions erected or altered by him, including Luton House, Syon House, Osterley, and Kenwood; also some of the houses in the Adelphi, London. His works of this class are agreeable in colour but poor and mannered in design; he was assisted in many of them by Angelica Kauffmann and her father. Zucchi was elected an associate of the Royal Academy in 1770, in which year and also in 1771, 1778, and 1779, he exhibited pictures of classical subjects. In July 1781 he married Angelica Kauffmann, and with her returned to Italy, where the remainder of his life was spent. He did little painting, dedicating himself instead to the administration of the considerable family fortune. Zucchi died at Rome on 25 December 1795, and was buried in the church of Sant'Andrea delle Fratte, where there is a monument to his memory and that of his celebrated wife. "

37078,Andrea Vaccaro,1604,1670,"Italian painter. He belonged to a large and important family of Neapolitan painters and was one of many artists influenced by the dramatic light effects of the Caravaggisti, followers of Caravaggio. He first studied literature but at an early age turned to painting. He was probably a pupil of the late-Mannerist painter Gerolamo Imparato, though there are no known works from this period. About 1620 he became a follower of Caravaggio; he copied Caravaggio's Flagellation (Naples, Capodimonte), and his copy and the original hung in S Domenico Maggiore, Naples (copy in situ). David with the Head of Goliath (Florence, Fondazione Longhi) and Sebastian (Naples, Capodimonte) are early works indebted to Caravaggio's naturalism and chiaroscuro. After 1630 Vaccaro drew inspiration from Guido Reni, Anthony van Dyck and Pietro Novelli and made copies of their works for Neapolitan collectors and dealers such as Gaspar Roomer and Jan Vandeneyden. Abraham and the Angels (private collection) dates from this period; Reni's images of saints are the forerunners of his St Rosalia (mid-1630s; Madrid, Prado) and Penitent Magdalene (1636; Naples, Certosa di S Martino, chapel of St Martin).

37097,Henry van de Velde,1863,1957,"Belgian architect, designer, and painter. He was an influential figure in progressive circles. Although he first practiced as a painter in Paris in the Neo-Impressionist and Symbolist styles, in 1892 he abandoned painting to concentrate on architecture and design, fields in which he was strongly influenced by the writings of British design reformers John Ruskin (1819-1900) and William Morris. After studying painting in Antwerp and later in Paris, van de Velde returned to Antwerp in 1886, where he joined the avant-garde artists' association, Les XX. In Brussels, he became increasingly influenced by English Arts and Crafts pioneers John Ruskin and William Morris and abandoned painting to pursue the design of interiors, book graphics, jewellery and metalwork. Like Morris, Van de Velde advocated the idea that all branches of art share a common language of form and are equally important to human existence. He saw ornament not as decoration but as a logical element of the total work and the result of formal, structural considerations. His forms evolved from plants and other natural motifs into an abstract style. He believed that contemporary design should be modern and express the needs of the day. Van de Velde's career can be divided into five periods based upon changes in his locale. The first Belgian period dates from 1893-1900, this was followed by an important phase in Berlin and Weimar (1900-17), where he became the artistic director to the Grand Duke of Saxony (c. 1902) and in 1908-14 directed the Weimar Kunstgewerbeschule (Weimar School of Arts and Crafts), a precursor to the Bauhaus. The third period was spent in Switzerland from 1917-20. A fourth phase in the Netherlands from 1921-25 was followed by a second Belgian period from 1925-48. In Brussels, he founded the Ecole Nationale Supérieure d'Architecture, which he ran from 1925 to 1936. He spent the last ten years of his life in Switzerland. After the turn of the century, Van de Velde became very influential in the field of aesthetics through his teaching and writing. His books, ""The Renaissance in Modern Applied Art"" (1901) and ""A Laymen's Sermons on Applied Art"" (1903), were essential theoretical sources for Art Nouveau and the development of 20th-century design and architecture. Van de Velde married in 1894. Next year he built a family home, Bloemenwerf (1895), near Brussels, for which he designed the architecture and house contents in a coherent, organic whole, down to his wife's dresses and jewellery. The house brought Van de Velde to the attention of the art historian, critic, and publisher, Julius Meier-Graefe, and the art dealer Samuel Bing. Bing, who was opening his boutique, L'Art Nouveau, in Paris, commissioned Van de Velde to design four rooms (a dining room, two salons, and a bedroom) for his shop. These designs were subsequently shown at the Exposition des Arts Appliqués in Dresden, Germany in 1897. From this time on, Van de Velde was in great demand in Germany. The influential German periodical, Pan, published his article on the making and fabrication of modern furniture along with a reduced version of the Tropon poster. In 1898, Van de Velde founded the Société Van de Velde for the popularization of construction and ornamentation. The same year, he also built a factory in Brussels for the production of interior furniture that was sold at Meier-Graefe's newly-opened Parisian shop, La Maison Moderne. "

41492,Piero di Cosimo,1462,1521,"Florentine painter, a pupil of Cosimo Rosselli, whose Christian name he adopted as a patronym. There are no signed, documented, or dated works by him, and reconstruction of his oeuvre depends on the account given in Vasari's Lives. It is one of Vasari's most entertaining biographies, for he portrays Piero as a highly eccentric character who lived on hard-boiled eggs, ""which he cooked while he was boiling his glue, to save the firing"". Piero helped Cosimo Rosselli in decorating the Sistine Chapel. Following this debut, his career progressed slowly, bur his style changed. He was influenced by Leonardo and by Luca Signorelli and Filippino Lippi. He excelled at painting animals with a sympathy rare in his age. The paintings for which he is best known are appropriately idiosyncratic - fanciful mythological inventions, inhabited by fauns, centaurs, and primitive men. There is sometimes a spirit of low comedy about these delightful works, but in the so-called Death of Procris (National Gallery, London) he created a poignant scene of the utmost pathos and tenderness. He was a marvellous painter of animals and the dog in this picture, depicted with a mournful dignity, is one of his most memorable creations. Piero also painted portraits, the finest of which is that of Simonetta Vespucci (Musée Condé, Chantilly), in which she is depicted as Cleopatra with the asp around her neck. His religious works are somewhat more conventional, although still distinctive. One of his outstanding religious works is the Immaculate Conception (Uffizi, Florence), which seems to have been the compositional model for the Madonna of the Harpies by his pupil Andrea del Sarto.

36540,John Singer Sargent,1856,1925,"American painter and draughtsman, active in England. The most fashionable portrait painter working in England and the USA in the late 19th century, he was brought up by expatriate American parents in an environment of restless travel and insulated family life. He was cosmopolitan in outlook, a linguist, a fine pianist and an avid reader of the classics. The spirit of self-sufficiency and isolation, both physical and emotional, remained with him all his life. He never married, grew wary of emotional entanglements and remained closest to his sisters, especially the eldest, Emily. He was educated in Italy, France, and Germany. In 1874 he went to Paris, where he studied under Carolus-Duran. He remained there for 10 years except for visits to the United States, Spain, and Africa. From his first exhibit in the Salon of 1878 he received early recognition, and by 1884, when he moved to London, he already enjoyed a high reputation as a portrait painter. He spent most of the remainder of his life there, painting the dashing portraits of American and English social celebrities for which he is famous. For a considerable period of time, Sargent was the world's best-known and most highly paid portrait painter. In 1890 he was commissioned by the architect Charles McKim to paint a series of murals, The History of Religion, for the Boston Public Library. He completed them in 1916. An untiring and prolific painter of great facility, Sargent was particularly brilliant in his treatment of textures. In his portraiture he showed great virtuosity in his handling of the brushstrokes, quickly capturing the likeness and vitality of his subject. His portraits nearly always flattered his sitters; he remarked upon this once, saying his was a pimp's profession. During his youth, and again after 1910, he deserted portrait painting long enough to produce a large number of brilliant impressionistic landscapes in watercolour, many of them painted in Venice and the Tyrol. Of these, fine collections are in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, and the Brooklyn Museum. His portraits and figure pieces are housed in many private and public collections in England and the United States. Well-known examples are the portrait of Isabella Stewart Gardner and El Jaleo (Gardner Museum, Boston); the portraits of Madame X, the Wyndham sisters, Henry Marquand, and William Merritt Chase (Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York); The Fountain (Art Institute, Chicago); and Daughters of E. D. Boit (Museum of Fine Arts, Boston). During the late 1990s and early 2000s Sargent was subject to wide-ranging critical reappraisal, provoking a renewed appreciation for his work. "

22503,François Rude,1784,1855,"French Romantic sculptor. He was a fervent admirer of Napoleon Bonaparte and his emotionally charged work expresses the martial spirit of the Napoleonic era more fully than that of any other sculptor. In 1812 he won the Prix de Rome, but he was unable to take it up because of the Napoleonic Wars, and when Napoleon abdicated in 1814 he went into exile in Brussels with David. On his return to Paris in 1827 he became highly successful with public monuments, most notably his celebrated high relief on the Arc de Triomphe, Departure of the Volunteers in 1792, popularly known as The Marseillaise (1833-36). None of Rude's other works matches the fire, dynamism, and heroic bravura of this glorification of the French Revolution, but he created another strikingly original work in his monument The Awakening of Napoleon (1845-47) in a park at Fixin, near his native Dijon, which shows the emperor casting off his shroud. In spite of the dramatic movement of his work, it always has a solidity that reveals his classical training and his lifelong admiration of the antique. "

41543,William Marlow,1740,1813,"English painter. From c. 1756 to 1761 he was a pupil of Samuel Scott, the topographical and marine painter; he also studied at the St Martin's Lane Academy, London. Throughout his career Marlow made oils and watercolours of London views, for example Near Westminster Bridge, Evening (London, Guildhall Art Gallery), which shows his balanced, classical sense of composition, sensitivity to lighting effects and smooth handling of oil paint. Between 1765 and 1766 Marlow travelled in France and Italy, making numerous drawings of ruins, which provided the subjects for many paintings finished on his return to London. An Oxcart in the Grotto of Posillipo (c. 1770; New Haven, CT, Yale Center for British Art) exemplifies his bold, blue-toned watercolour style, with washes applied in loose blotches to emphasize the picturesque roughness of masonry and terrain. The handling has much in common with Canaletto, whom Marlow copied; a letter of 1771 from Horace Walpole to Sir Horace Mann records that two views of Verona by Marlow were mistakenly sold as Canalettos. Marlow specialized in souvenirs of the Grand Tour, portraits of country houses, seascapes and river scenes. He visited many parts of Britain and Ireland in search of subjects, such as Powys Castle, Montgomeryshire (University of Manchester, Whitworth Art Gallery). He exhibited at the Incorporated Society of Artists from 1767, was made a Fellow in 1771 and Vice-President in 1778. He exhibited at the Royal Academy, London, from 1788 to 1807 but never sought membership. "

In 1770 and 1772 he exhibited portraits at the Royal Academy and showed his first subject picture in 1773. He left for a period of study in Italy and was in Rome with Joseph Wright of Derby from 1773 to 1774. When he next exhibited at the Royal Academy (1777) he was living in Cambridge, but from 1778 to 1804 his considerable annual contribution to the Academy exhibitions was sent from various London addresses. His very popular small portraits were often shown in groups of six or nine. His occasional subject pictures were based on themes from mythology, classical history, poetry and the theatre. They included a scene from As You Like It (untraced) painted for John Boydell's Shakespeare Gallery. Downman became ARA (Associate of the Royal Academy) in 1795 and travelled widely in later life, marrying in Exeter in 1806 and sending works to the Royal Academy (1805-12 and 1816-19) from all over the country. Although his work as a small-scale portraitist is widely known, his subject pieces are today rare, despite exhibiting more than two dozen at the Academy. They have, in all probability, suffered the same fate of many unsigned 18th century oil paintings, being erroneously attributed to other artists. "

36350,Guido Reni,1575,1642,"Italian painter of popular religious works and critically acclaimed mythological scenes. He was born in Bologna and began to study painting at the age of nine; he joined the Carracci Academy when he was 20. His studies were rounded off by a trip to Rome in about 1600. From that moment on, antique and recent Roman art became his ideals. He admired Raphael unconditionally. He did, however, come to terms with Caravaggio's naturalism in a group of youthful works such as The Crucifixion of St Peter in the Vatican Gallery (1604), where the use of chiaroscuro provided enormous energy. He alternated between living in his native Bologna and visits to Rome. After Annibale Carracci's death (1609) he became the leader of the classical school of Emilian painters. His adhesion to this school can be seen in the frescos he painted in Rome in about 1610 in the Quirinal Palace, the Vatican, and various churches (e.g. San Gregorio Magno al Cielo). They were inspired by the return to classical taste and culminated in Aurora in Palazzo Ludovisi which has almost mimetic qualities. The large altarpieces he painted in Bologna - The Massacre of the Innocents and Pietà dei Mendicanti both in the Bologna Pinacoteca Nazionale - mark the triumph of design, the ability to control and channel feelings, gestures, expressions, drawing, and colour into a single, eloquent, and faultless form. Guido Reni's success was underlined by the important commissions he received. They included the cycle of The Labors of Hercules (1617-21) that he painted for the Duke of Mantua and which are now in the Louvre. He exalted the clarity of light, the perfection of the body, and lively colour. Toward the end of his life, Reni modified his style. His paintings became so airy as to seem insubstantial and were almost completely monochrome. He also used long, flowing brushstrokes and conveyed an atmosphere laden with intense melancholy. Guido Reni was a quintessentially classical academic but he was also one of the most elegant painters in the annals of art history. He was constantly seeking an absolute, rarefied perfection which he measured against classical Antiquity and Raphael. Because of this, over the years the Bolognese painter has been in and out of fashion, depending on the tastes of the times. The eighteenth century loved him, the nineteenth century, persuaded by the violent criticism of John Ruskin, hated him. But even his detractors cannot deny the exceptional technical quality of his work nor the clarity of his supremely assured and harmonious brushwork. "

He is known mainly for his history pieces, genre depictions, and whimsical and imaginary landscapes, including veduta di fantasia or capricci. Most of his output was while working in Venice or in the near mainland (Ferrara, Trieste, and Padua). He died in Milan. "

His first works, mostly landscapes in watercolour, painted on the outskirts of Paris, display an independent character that owes little to the influence of his father or the other artists among whom he had lived. In 1820 he travelled to Normandy with his father, Charles Nodier and Alphonse de Cailleux, the future director of the Louvre. In 1821 he visited Britain with Nodier and discovered British painting; it is uncertain whether Isabey ever met Richard Parkes Bonington (his father certainly knew him), but Bonington's free watercolour technique had a decisive influence on his development. Isabey's admiration for Géricault, the advice of his friends and a passionate temperament also helped to form his style, which was characterized by skilfully worked brushstrokes and a preference for impasto rather than glazing. Between 1821 and 1824 Isabey seems to have returned to Normandy several times, painting on the coast between Le Havre and Dieppe. At the Salon of 1824 he exhibited a series of seascapes and landscapes (untraced), which helped to establish his reputation. He was also a genre painter and also made lithographs. He is well represented at the Louvre; the Metropolitan Museum has one of his paintings. "

40539,Jean-Charles Delafosse,1734,1789,"French decorative designer, engraver and architect. In 1747 he was apprenticed to the sculptor Jean-Baptiste Poullet (d. 1775), but he seems not to have completed his apprenticeship. By 1767 he styled himself 'architecte et professeur pour le dessin'. In 1768 he published the first volume of his most important work, the Nouvelle iconologie historique. It contains 110 plates, nearly all engraved by Delafosse himself, with designs for furniture, decorative objects and architectural ornament in the heavy, classicising, Louis XVI style. In addition, each design bears a particular, usually complex, symbolic or iconological meaning, pertaining to an almost encyclopedic range of subject-matter. In some of his designs Delafosse manipulated abstract shapes in new ways, using such forms as truncated columns, cones, pyramids, spheres, discs and rectangles, sometimes carefully shaded to appear simultaneously three-dimensional and flat. His compositional methods were characteristic of the most revolutionary architectural designs of the period, such as those of Étienne-Louis Boullée and Claude-Nicolas Ledoux. In these images he used discrepancies of size, employing Piranesi's device of juxtaposing tiny human figures with immense architectural elements, sometimes heavily rusticated to emphasize the contrast further; reversals of weight and balance; and spatial ambiguities, playing off three-dimensional objects against two-dimensional shapes. He divorced familiar architectural elements - the base of a column, a pediment, a single Ionic volute - from their usual functions and placed them in new and witty contexts. Delafosse was responsible for two houses (1776-83) in the Rue du Faubourg-Poissonière, Paris: the Hôtel Titon and the Hôtel Goix. They show little structural innovation, but their ornamentation reveals characteristic touches: at the Hôtel Titon there are lions' heads decorating the main entrance, laurel branches above the doors, friezes of classical arabesques between the floor levels in the inner courtyard and two large classical urns in niches in the vestibule. In 1780 Delafosse was in Bordeaux, where in 1781 he became a member of the Académie de Peinture. In 1789 he joined the Garde National, Paris, and he is known to have played an active role in the Revolution. "

40610,Vincent van Gogh,1853,1890,"Dutch painter and draftsman, born in Groot-Zundert, North Brabant, where his father was the Protestant pastor. His birthplace lay in the midst of flat country intersected by canals. He grew up in an old-fashioned country-house in the company of a number of younger brothers and sisters. His mother, with whom he had a great inward affinity, was named Anna-Cornelia Carbentus. In 1869, through his uncle, an art dealer, he obtained a post as a salesman in The Hague offices of Goupil and Co., a firm of art dealers and printsellers. In 1873 he was transferred to a newly opened London branch of Goupil and Co. In London, he had opportunities for studying art, for seeing all kind of works. In 1875 he moved to Paris, to the head office of the firm. In Paris he saw a large exhibition of drawings and pastels by Millet. In March 1876 he was dismissed from Goupil and Co, and returned to England to teach in a school for poor children in Ramsgate, and afterwards became an assistant at a church school outside London. He went up to London to see the galleries. In 1877 he returned to The Netherlands and worked in a bookshop in Dordrecht. In May he went to Amsterdam and entered the University to study theology. In 1878 he find the academic studies in Greek and Hebrew too taxing and withdrew from the course. He moved to Brussels to train as an evangelist. In November he was sent to the mining district of the Borinage in southern Belgium. In 1879 he was dismissed from his probationary post and refused a full appointment on grounds of inadequacy as a preacher. In the summer of 1880 he decided to become an artist and took up drawing with the financial assistance of his brother Theo, four years his junior. He studied the work of Millet, Daubigny and Rousseau by making copies. In October he moved to the art centre of Brussels and met Anthon van Rappard (1858-1892), a young Dutch artist. In April 1881 he returned to Etten in Brabant and made drawings of local peasants. In August he visited The Hague and made contact with artists leaving there, especially a cousin, Anton Mauve (1838-1888). In December he settled in The Hague, working initially under Mauve's supervision. In September 1883 he left The Hague and moved to the northern province of Drenthe, a popular place with artists of the Hague School. Here he took up painting seriously. In December he went to the new family home in Nuenen, Brabant. He painted here in dark, heavy colours which even at this time he was fond of contrasting and weighing against one another. The figures and land in these paintings were Dutch. In 1885 he painted The Potato-Eaters as a culmination of his studies of the local agricultural workers and weavers. In November 1885 he moved to Antwerp where he was able to study works of Rubens and the Japanese artists. In March 1886 he traveled to Paris, where he lived with his brother. He entered the studio of Fernand Cormon (1845-1924). In the autumn he met John Russell, who introduced him to Impressionist techniques. Later he met other painters - Signac, Bernard and Gauguin. He worked in the streets, at Montmartre, in the environs of Paris, at Chatou, Bougival and Suresnes. He painted the little restaurants in the bright colours of spring, in bright blue and pink. He painted Père Tanguy in whose shop paintings by Pissarro, Cézanne, Renoir, Sisley, Seurat, Guillaumin and Signac were to be found. Van Gogh remained in Paris for 20 months and profited from his stay. Under the influence of Impressionism his palette was liberated. But the frenetic life was too much for him; he wanted a place of light and warmth, and he did not want to be entirely financially dependent on Theo, so in February 1888 he left for Arles in southern France. In Arles he took a room in a small hotel, which had a café beneath it. He painted and drew every day without a pause. He painted squares and streets of the town, the Alyscamps, the public gardens, the bridge, sunsets over Arles, fields with the railway in the background. He painted the blossoms of the fruit trees, gardens with gaily-coloured flowers, still-lifes. He painted also portraits - his own, time after time, the Berceuse, the Arlésienne, the Zouave, the peasants of the Camargue, the postman Roulin. He went to Les Saintes-Maries-de-la Mer and painted the sea and the boats. He rented a house, painted it yellow and adorned it with six pictures of sunflowers. Gauguin, responding to his invitation, came to stay with van Gogh from October to December 1888, They spoke a great deal about art, Gauguin assuming a didactic tone which accentuated van Gogh's irritability. It appears that van Gogh threw a glass at his friend's head and another occasion threatened him with a razor. In a moment of mental derangement he cut off his own ear in the course of his first attack of dementia. Gauguin left Arles and van Gogh was taken to hospital where his disease took the form of hallucinations. He spent a few weeks in the hospital during which he created some beautiful pictures: several self-portraits, the garden of the hospital, the inner room with the stove. In May 1889 he entered the sanatorium of Saint-Paul-de-Mausole at Saint-Rémy as a third-class voluntary patient. Here he continued to paint a number of pictures of everything which surrounded him: the house and the garden seen from all angles, landscapes seen from the open window, with cypresses and olive trees, more self-portraits, the doctor, the attendant. He created some of his maturest and most beautiful works, the copies made from reproductions after Rembrandt, Delacroix, Daumier and Millet. In January 1890 an article on his work by Albert Aurier was published in the Mercure de France. He exhibited at the Belgian exhibition of Les Vingt, where he sold The Red Vineyard to Anna Boch. The sojourn in Saint-Rémy became intolerable to him and he decided to go to Auvers-sur-Oise and place himself in the care of Dr. Gachet, a friend of Impressionist painters. In May 1890 he moved to Auvers, visiting Paris on the way. Van Gogh's last three months were spent in Auvers near Pissarro, painting the sympathetic, eccentric Dr. Gachet and portraits of his daughters, as well as the Church of Auvers, agitated by a baroque rhythm with the church silhouetted against a cobalt sky. The blue of the Auvers period was not the fully saturated blue of Arles but a more mysterious, flickering blue. Vincent's consciousness of his burden upon Theo, by then married and a father, increased. His work tempo was pushed to the limit; one of his last paintings, Wheat Field With Crows, projected ominous overtones of distress. On 27 July he shot himself in the stomach and died on 29 July in the arms of his brother. Theo died six months thereafter. They are buried side by side in the little churchyard of Auvers-sur-Oise. Assessment Van Gogh's life and work are legendary in the history of art, making him the quintessential misunderstood, tormented, even insane artist, who sold only one work in his lifetime but whose paintings achieved record auction sales prices after his death. His brief, turbulent, and tragic life is thought to epitomize the mad genius legend. His formal distortions and humanistic concerns made him a principal forerunner of 20th-century expressionism. Van Gogh was active as an artist for only ten years, during which time he produced around 1.000 watercolours, drawings and sketches and nearly 1.250 paintings. His styles included an early dark, Realist style and a later colourful, intense, expressionistic style. Almost more than on his oeuvre, his fame has been based on the extensive, diary-like correspondence he maintained, in particular with his brother, Theo. "

34044,John Sell Cotman,1782,1842,"English painter and etcher. He moved from Norwich to London in 1798, aged 16, and became a member of Dr Monro's circle. As far as is known, he had no formal tuition in art, but by 1800 he was already accomplished enough to have six of his watercolours accepted for the annual Royal Academy exhibition. Between 1800 and 1805 he made several sketching tours to Wales and Yorkshire and these resulted in some of his finest works. They did not bring him much success, however, and in 1806 he returned to his native city, where, together with Crome, he became the most important representative of the Norwich School. As well as depicting local scenery, he made several trips to France, which bore fruit in Architectural Antiquities of Normandy (1822), one of various books he illustrated with his etchings. In 1834 he moved to London to become professor of drawing at King's College, a position he held until his death. He was delighted to be offered the post, as he often had difficulty in making a living with his work and he was in debt at the time. Throughout his life he was also subject to periods of melancholia and despondency. Cotman's early watercolours, such as the celebrated Greta Bridge (c.1805, British Museum, London; a later version, 1810, is in the Castle Museum, Norwich), include some of the greatest examples of the classic English watercolour technique, showing remarkable boldness and sureness of hand. He used large flat washes to build up form in clearly defined planes and shapes of almost geometrical simplicity. In his later years, however, his style became much more flamboyant; he sometimes mixed flour or rice paste with his watercolours to produce an impasto that echoed the effects of oil paint. Throughout his career he also painted in oils, but this side of his work has been overshadowed by his achievements as a watercolourist. "

53483,Eugène Gaillard,1862,1933,"French designer. He was a barrister by profession but abandoned a career in law for interior design and decoration. Although known almost exclusively for his furniture, he also designed a wide range of objects and decorative schemes in an elegant Art Nouveau style. Early in his career, Gaillard collaborated in Siegfried Bing's fashionable Art Nouveau shop in Paris. Together with Georges de Feure and Edward Colonna, he created interiors and furniture for Bing's pavilion, Art Nouveau Bing (destroyed), at the Exposition Universelle of 1900 in Paris. Under Bing's direction, these artists carried out an aesthetic programme that laid claim to 'the old French tradition' infused with 'a lively spirit of modernity'. Gaillard was responsible for three rooms in the pavilion: the vestibule, dining room and bedroom. French precedents, especially elements from the Rococo style, were freely used as a source of inspiration. In the vestibule, Gaillard installed a mosaic floor, bold pink draperies and a stencilled frieze that effectively set off a walnut portmanteau with mirrored back and shelves. The dining room was furnished in walnut, ornamented with scrolled foliage and panelled wainscot, beneath a mural painted by the Spanish artist José María Sert (1876-1945). Later in his career Gaillard designed deeply moulded furniture with sharply curved corners displaying carved decoration; he consistently favoured sinuously flowing, carved panels and ormolu drawer pulls. His popular chairs do not exhibit excessive ornamentation, being of a plainer, heavier construction, often with leather seats instead of decorative upholstery fabrics. About 1903, Gaillard ended his collaboration with Bing and established his own firm, which produced furniture of similar designs. By 1907 Gaillard had simplified his designs significantly; his furniture became lighter in contrast to the rather ponderous style of earlier pieces, and the decoration was less strident. Until 1914 Eugène Gaillard designed exquisitely elegant furniture in the Art nouveau style. His approach to design and motifs reveals floral inspiration yet was not intended to imitate nature, as he explained in a 1906 essay entitled ""À Propos du Mobilier"". Gaillard's designs developed from stylized naturalism to abstract decoration and ultimately to a phase of simplification with the introduction of clearly defined planes and curved lines. Little is known about the later phase of his career. "

9383,Paul Gavarni,1804,1866,"French caricaturist and illustrator, real name Guillaume Sulpice Chevalier. He was born in Paris and largely self-taught as an artist. He began his career as an engraver and after 1830 was a fashion illustrator. Subsequently he became a caricaturist, specializing in satiric studies of Parisian life, which he contributed to a number of Parisian periodicals, including the magazine Charivari. Among his better-known works are the series Les fourberies de femme en matière de sentiment (Treachery of Women in Matters of Sentiment) and Les lorettes (The Prostitutes). Gavarni lived in London from 1847 to 1851; deeply moved by the economic misery of the poorer classes there, he thenceforth used his satiric approach to life to stress social problems. The end of Gavarni's career was not as publicly brilliant as the beginning. After his return from another trip to London, where he spent time observing the urban poor, he lived in semi-retirement, producing his last series in 1857-58. Much of his work from this time period is more somber, dark, nostalgic and moralistic.Gavarni was also a watercolorist and a noted illustrator of books. In all, Gavarni executed about 8000 drawings, lithographs, and watercolours. "

15563,Adolf Loos,1870,1933,"Austrian architect and applied arts designer. He attended the Staatsgewerbeschule in Reichenberg before he began his studies at the Technical College in Dresden. After this time, he spent three years in Philadelphia (U.S.A.), working various jobs. He returned to Europe in 1896 and settled down in Vienna. In 1897, the Vienna Secession was founded. Loos established himself as a formidable critic of its fin-de-siècle culture, seen in the burgeoning Sezessionstil and the Gesamtkunstwerk ideal of such architects, as Josef Hoffmann and Joseph Maria Olbrich. In October 1897, Loos's radical polemic began to appear in Die Zeit and turned into a spate of articles in the following year, mainly in the Neue Freie Presse. These covered a wide range of subjects, including, in addition to architecture, furnishings, dress and music, on which Loos adopted a puritanical approach. The radical defence of his theories and his article ""Die Potemkinsche Stadt"", published in the journal Ver Sacrum in the summer of 1898 in a very polemic manner, led to the final break with the leading architects of the Wiener Secession: Josef Hoffmann and Josef Maria Olbrich. At the same time, Loos developed an affinity for the underplayed styles emerging from the English Arts and Crafts movement, admiring the simplification of form and unadorned surfaces of the English domestic revival of the 1890s. In 1920, he was appointed chief architect to the housing department of the city of Vienna, which was suffering from a chronic shortage of housing. He produced numerous housing projects in which he tried to break away from the conventional courtyard plan. In 1922, he moved to Paris, where he exerted a significant influence upon modern French architecture, in particular Le Corbusier (1887-1965. He gave lectures at the Sorbonne and constructed a house and atelier for the dadaist Tristan Tzara. In 1928 Loos returned to Vienna, and in a series of houses built in Vienna and Prague towards the end of his career, he fully developed the Raumplan concept. Major architectural works by Adolf Loos are the Café Museum, Vienna (1899); Villa Karma, Montreux (1904); American Bar, Vienna (1908); Looshaus, Vienna (1910); Steiner House, Vienna (1910); Rufer House, Vienna (1922); Tristan Tzara House, Paris (1925); residential interiors, Plzen. Of some 30 articles written by Loos during 1904-14, undoubtedly the most influential was  'Ornament und Verbrechen' and 'Architektur'. The former, which equates human cultural development with the progressive shedding of ornament, is widely dated to 1908 and used to exemplify Loos's early influence in determining the character of Modernist architecture. In the latter, he advocated simplicity. "

49098,Baccio Bandinelli,1488,1560,"Florentine sculptor, painter, and draughtsman. He was a favourite of the Medici family, but he is remembered more for his unattractive character and the antipathy of his contemporaries than for the quality of his work. Probably before 1508, he had worked with the sculptor Giovanni Francesco Rustici and would therefore have been aware of the drawings and sculpture of Leonardo da Vinci, with whom Rustici was then creating the bronze group of St John the Baptist Preaching (Florence Cathedral, Baptistery). Bandinelli also learnt from them how to model sculpture in wax and clay for casting into bronze. He was awarded the commission for his first important sculpture: a St Peter in marble (1515–17), for the crossing of Florence Cathedral. Monumental statues of muscular, nude Classical gods or heroes - often showing Hercules, but sometimes Neptune - obsessed the sculptor. Only a few of these were actually executed, but they are recorded in a plethora of drawings. He proposed to Leo X a model of David Severing Goliath's Head to replace Donatello's David (Florence, Bargello), which had been removed from the courtyard of the Palazzo Medici, Florence, by the Republicans, but instead he was commissioned to carve a statue of Orpheus (c. 1519; in situ) for this position. Its composition was derived from that of the Apollo Belvedere (Rome, Vatican, Museo Pio-Clementino), and it is accounted one of his best early works. This exercise in the style of antiquity was followed by a direct copy (c. 1520–22; Florence, Uffizi) of the famous Laocoön, the Hellenistic sculptural group that had been excavated as recently as 1506 and was also in the Belvedere of the Vatican. Before this, Baccio was sent off to Loreto to help Andrea Sansovino with one of the large reliefs for the marble revetment of the Santa Casa inside the basilica; he made several preparatory sketches and began carving the Birth of the Virgin between 1517 and 1519 (in situ), but abandoned work about half way through (the panel was eventually finished, 1530–33, by Raffaello da Montelupo). Returning to Rome in mid-1519, Bandinelli designed a large and complex Massacre of the Innocents to be engraved (c. 1520–21) by Marco Dente. It enhanced Bandinelli's reputation internationally. In July 1525 a colossal block of marble that had been quarried many years before at Carrara and had been intended for Michelangelo to carve a pendant to his own David was brought to Florence on the orders of the Pope and handed over to Bandinelli. In the following years Bandinelli carved out of it his colossal group of Hercules and Cacus (Piazza della Signoria, in situ), finally unveiled in 1534. From 1525, Bandinelli was simultaneously engaged on a variety of projects, including some abortive ones for paintings. However, receiving severe criticism from Michelangelo he decided to abandon painting, though he continued to draw compositions for others to colour. In 1529, he received a commission in Genoa to produce a monument to Admiral Andrea I Doria. This commission was abandoned in 1538, resulting only in a roughed-out group with the Admiral in the guise of Neptune standing tamely and improbably on the heads of a pair of dolphins (Carrara, Piazza del Duomo. He was rewarded with a knighthood in the Order of Santiago, which he had long coveted, and this occasioned an impressive painted Self-Portrait (Boston, Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum). One of Bandinelli's great undertakings in the 1540s was for the Udienza, or stage, in the Salone del Cinquecento in the Palazzo della Signoria, which Cosimo had taken over as his residence. This project had to be brought to completion later on by other sculptor. The project to replace Brunelleschi's octagonal wooden choir enclosure and altar under the crossing of Florence Cathedral with a grand new marble one, decorated with bronze reliefs and marble statuary, was begun in 1547. Its balustrade survives and once contained a series of 88 upright rectangular panels of individual Old Testament figures, depicted in a great variety of poses and from different angles, in characteristically academic fashion (64 panels in situ, the rest in Florence, Museo dell'Opera del Duomo). In his last period, Bandinelli produced, in collaboration with his son Clemente (1534–1555), an over life-size group of the Dead Christ Supported by Nicodemus, the latter given his own features, for his tomb in Santissima Annunziata. This was doubtless inspired by the knowledge that Michelangelo was working on a Pietà for his tomb (Florence, Museo dell'Opera del Duomo). Bandinelli excelled at disegno, that combination of design and drawing that underlay contemporary artistic practice and theory. His  graphic compositions and carved reliefs, both of large, complex groups and of single figures in sophisticated poses, have been universally admired. "

47985,Jean-Pierre Dantan,1800,1869,"Jean-Pierre Dantan, known as Dantan the Younger, was part of a French family of sculptors. Together with his brother, Antoine-Laurent Dantan (1798-1878), known as Dantan the Elder, they both served an apprenticeship with their father, an ornamental wood-carver. Antoine-Laurent entered the Ecole des Beaux-Arts, Paris, in 1816, and Jean-Pierre in 1823. Both were the pupils of François-Joseph Bosio, who passed on to them his skill in elegant, conventional portraiture. While the elder brother was preparing his entry for the Prix de Rome, the younger worked on a variety of decorative commissions. By 1826 he had executed a statuette (Paris, Carnavalet) portraying César Ducornet (1805-56), an armless painter. Because of the subject's disability, this work cannot rank as the first of his caricatures or portraits chargés, as Jean-Pierre termed his subsequent humorous sculptures; but the interest in physical peculiarities that it displays was in accordance with the Romantics' desire to accommodate the full range of natural phenomena, even the disturbing.

42050,Giovanni Battista Caracciolo,1578,1635,"Neapolitan painter, called Battistello. He was one of the greatest Caravaggio's followers, and his powerful work was an important factor in making Naples a stronghold of the Caravaggesque style. He only appe/red on the Neapolitan art scene when he was 30, in the first decade of the seventeenth century when Caravaggio was working in the city. A group of paintings commissioned for Neapolitan churches reveals that he could interpret intelligently Caravaggio's realism. He used strong chiaroscuro backgrounds against which sculpturally defined figures stood out. The decisive impact that Caravaggio made on his style can be seen from his Liberation of St Peter (1608-09), painted for the same church (the Chiesa  del Monte della Misericordia, in storage in the Museo Nazionale di Capodimonte, Naples) as the master's Seven Acts of Mercy. It shows how Caracciolo, unlike so many of the Caravaggisti, looked beyond the obvious trademarks of Caravaggio's style, emulating it in depth of feeling as well as in mastery of dramatic light and shade. His painting became more polished after a trip to Rome in 1614. By then Battistello had become the leader of the Neapolitan school and divided his time between religious subjects (altarpieces and, unusually for a Caravaggist, frescos) and paintings for private patrons. In 1618 he left for Genoa but spent some time in both Rome and Florence in the second decade of the century. During these stays he learnt of the Carraccis' revived classicism and met with like-minded painters wishing to reform Caravaggio's legacy. Unusually for a Caravaggesque artist, he was an accomplished fresco painter,  and back in Naples, he translated his experience into grandiose, wide-ranging scenes. An example is his masterpiece Washing of the Feet of 1622, painted for the Certosa di San Martino in Naples. The decorations in the Certosa were finished in 1631. "
37150,Andrea del Verrocchio,1435,1488,"Andrea del Verrocchio (originally Andrea di Cione), Florentine sculptor and painter, who is ranked second only to Donatello among the Italian sculptors of the early Renaissance. His equestrian statue of Bartolomeo Colleoni, erected in Venice in 1496, is particularly important. Little accurate biographical information is known about Verrocchio. He was the son of Michele di Francesco Cioni, a maker of bricks and tiles who later became a tax collector. Financial security always seemed to be a family problem. Verrocchio had to support several of his brothers and sisters. Never marrying, he later provided for the education and dowries of the daughters of his younger brother Tommaso. Initially he was trained as a goldsmith. His master has traditionally been recorded as a supposed goldsmith, Giuliano Verrocchi, whose last name Andrea apparently took as his own. Another questionable biographical tradition is that of his apprenticeship under Donatello, the greatest Italian sculptor of the early Renaissance. Since the stylistic affinity of Verrocchio's early sculpture is with the work of Antonio Rossellino rather than Donatello, this liaison seems doubtful. His first studies in painting date possibly from the mid-1460s. He is said to have been a pupil of the Florentine artist Alesso Baldovinetti. But it is assumed that he and Sandro Botticelli worked together under the early Renaissance master Fra Filippo Lippi at Prato, a city near Florence, where Lippi had been commissioned to execute a series of murals for the cathedral. Verrocchio's most important works were executed in the last two decades of his life. His rise to artistic prominence, which he owed chiefly to encouragement by Piero de' Medici and his son Lorenzo, the leading art patrons of Florence, evidently began only after the death, in 1466, of Donatello, who had been the Medici favourite. Besides the paintings and sculptures Verrocchio produced for the Medici, he designed costumes and decorative armour for their festivals, tournaments, and solemn receptions. Made curator of the collection of antiquities in the Medici palace, he restored many pieces of ancient Roman sculpture, especially portrait busts. It appears that Verrocchio produced few works for patrons outside of Florence. Though he is said to have worked in Rome for Pope Sixtus IV among others, there is no documentary trace that he ever left the area around Florence until the early 1480s, when he moved to Venice, where he died within a few years. Even while he was in Venice his Florentine workshop was maintained and directed by his favourite student, Lorenzo di Credi who was also the administrator and principal heir of Verrocchio's estate. Verrocchio's reputation was widespread in the second half of the 15th century and many well-known artists of the Italian Renaissance studied painting and sculpture at his Florentine studio. The most important of his students were Leonardo da Vinci and Perugino, the latter Raphael's teacher. The mural painter Domenico Ghirlandajo, Michelangelo's master, was temporarily in close contact with Verrocchio. Sandro Botticelli, the major Florentine painter of the late 15th century, and Francesco di Giorgio, the important Sienese artist, clearly oriented themselves toward Verrocchio's art in certain phases of their development, as did the prominent Florentine sculptors Benedetto da Maiano and Andrea Sansovino. The only surviving painting that according to documentary proof should be by Verrocchio, an altarpiece of the Madonna and Child with Saints in the Donato de' Medici Chapel of the cathedral at Pistoia, was not completed by the master himself. Largely executed by his pupil Lorenzo di Credi, its handling is inconsistent with that of the Baptism of Christ (c. 1474/75; Uffizi, Florence), which has been attributed to Verrocchio ever since it was first mentioned in 1550 by the Renaissance biographer Giorgio Vasari (1511-74) in his Vite de' più eccellenti pittori, scultori, ed architettori italiani . . . (Lives of the Most Eminent Italian Painters, Sculptors, and Architects . . . ). One of the two angels and part of the distant landscape in the Baptism, however, were certainly painted by his apprentice, the young Leonardo da Vinci. Other paintings ascribed to Verrocchio are the Madonna in the Staatliche Museen, Berlin, the Tobias and the Angel in the National Gallery in London, and the altarpiece in Argiano, with Christ on the Cross between St Jerome and St Anthony. After the mid-1470s Verrocchio dedicated himself principally to sculpture, in which he manifested strong personal convictions and an inventive ability. The sculptural works either recorded to be by Verrocchio or actually extant are few in number. According to his brother Tommaso, Verrocchio was responsible for an inlaid slab (1467) in the Florentine church of S. Lorenzo recording the burial place of Cosimo de' Medici, who died in 1464. In 1468 Verrocchio is known to have executed a bronze candlestick (Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam) for the Palazzo della Signoria in Florence. This work was followed by his first major commission, the tomb of Piero and Giovanni de' Medici in the Old Sacristy of S. Lorenzo. Completed in 1472, this sarcophagus, set in an archway, is impressive for its originality of composition and its inspired use of coloured marble and porphyry in conjunction with rich bronze ornamentation. Verrocchio's earliest surviving example of figurative sculpture is a small bronze statue of David (Bargello, Florence), which is generally dated before 1476. A second bronze figure, the Putto with Dolphin, is important in the development of freestanding Renaissance sculpture for its spiral design, which represents a successful effort to evolve a pose in which all views are of equal significance. It was originally commissioned for a fountain in the Medici villa in Careggi, near Florence. The putto, sometimes called a cupid, is precisely balanced in the projection of its limbs and probably was placed initially on a fountain so that it could be turned by the pressure of streams or jets of water. In the mid-16th century it was reinstalled on top of a fountain designed for the courtyard of the Palazzo Vecchio in Florence (the original is now kept in the Palazzo Vecchio museum; the present fountain figure is a copy). Verrocchio's reputation as one of the great relief sculptors of the 15th century was clearly established with his cenotaph, or memorial, in the cathedral at Pistoia, to a Tuscan ecclesiastical dignitary, Cardinal Niccolò Forteguerri. Ordered in 1476, the cenotaph was still unfinished when Verrocchio died, and its completion was entrusted first to Lorenzo di Credi, then to Lorenzetti, and finally to a minor Italian Baroque sculptor. Though its effect has been altered by changes and additions foreign to Verrocchio's original design, the Forteguerri cenotaph contains some of the artist's most important relief sculpture. Its scenographic arrangement of the figures into a dramatically unified composition anticipates the theatrical effect of the dynamically composed wall reliefs executed by Baroque sculptors of the 17th century. Another relief dates from 1478/79, when it was decided to extend the silver altar in the baptistery of the cathedral of Florence, and one of the four supplementary scenes was allotted to Verrocchio. Depicting the Beheading of St John the Baptist (Museo dell'Opera del Duomo, Florence), this work was delivered in 1480. Dating from about 1477/78 is a terra-cotta relief of the Madonna (Bargello, Florence) coming from the Florentine hospital of Sta. Maria Nuova. In the late 1470s Verrocchio produced two portrait sculptures. A penetrating realism distinguishes his terra-cotta bust of Giuliano de' Medici (in the National Gallery of Art, Washington) from the idealization of the individual that characterizes his marble bust known as Lady with Primroses (Bargello, Florence). The latter work created a new type of Renaissance bust, in which the arms of the sitter are included in the manner of ancient Roman models. This compositional device allows the hands, as well as the face, to express the character and mood of the sitter. Perhaps the most important work Verrocchio executed in Florence was a bronze group of Christ and St. Thomas commissioned for a niche in the east exterior wall of the Or San Michele in Florence. Executed between 1467 and 1483, the work is remarkable for its technical perfection, highly intellectual sense of compositional design, and understanding of the subtle emotional nature of the subject. In 1483 Verrocchio was commissioned by the Venetian government to undertake a second major work in bronze, a commemorative statue of Bartolomeo Colleoni, a condottiere, or professional soldier, who had been employed by the Venetian republic. At Verrocchio's death the model was not yet cast, and the work of casting and chasing, or polishing, was entrusted to the Venetian sculptor Alessandro Leopardi. It was erected in 1496 in the Piazza SS. Giovanni e Paolo in Venice. The movement of the horse and commanding forward gaze of Colleoni gives the impression that the warrior is riding into battle at the head of his troops, who press behind. This innovative scenographic conception was influential in the development of the equestrian figures executed from the Baroque period of the 17th century to those produced in the 19th century by sculptors of the Romantic style. Besides Donatello's monument to the condottiere Gattamelata (c. 1447-53) at Padua, Verrocchio's Colleoni monument is aesthetically the most important equestrian statue of the Renaissance. Contrived with great technical assurance and modelled with power and sensitivity, it forms a fitting climax to Verrocchio's sculptural career. "

The son of painter Battista Franco, with whom he began his artistic training at the age of eleven, he worked as a painter, engraver, woodcutter, and dealer in graphics and books. For a while he studied in Bologna with Agostino Carracci. Possibly as a result of his study with Agostino Carracci, Franco published a collection of his own ""facsimile font"" figure studies in 1596, in which one or two human figures are positioned to form each of the letters of the alphabet. In 1595 he took over his father's workshop and eventually became a well-known publisher. Although he was not documented as belonging to the booksellers' or printers' guilds, he is recorded in 1606 and again in 1619 as belonging to the painters' guild. Franco's determination to be recognized as an artist is reflected in his will, in which he refers to himself as a ""designer."" Apart from his numerous works as an engraver and woodcutter, Franco also proved to be a pleasing portraitist. "

Jean is first mentioned in a document of 1504, when he is referred to as a master painter, a burgher and married. His teacher is unknown, but his work bears some imprint of the art of Jan Provost, who inherited Simon Marmion’s studio. However, Bellegambe might equally have been apprenticed in Bruges or Brussels (possibly in the atelier of the Master of the Legend of St Mary Magdalen, for example), or even in Antwerp. The calm and serenity of Bellegambe’s compositions, his treatment of landscape, his lightness of technique, his pursuit of clear, soft colours and delicate harmonies all indicate links with the work of Gérard David and Quentin Massys. In the 17th century Bellegambe was known as 'the Master of Colours'. "

He trained as a reproductive engraver with Pierre-François Basan and later with Jacques-Philippe Lebas but soon turned to small-scale engraving. He specialized in the extremely meticulous execution of small portraits; he made more than 100 of these, the most popular being those of Marie Leczinska, Queen of France (1768) after Jean-Marc Nattier and the portrait of the Comtesse du Barry (1770) after Hubert Drouais. His greatest work was the Crowning of the Bust of Voltaire at the Comédie Française after a drawing by Jean-Michel Moreau (1778; Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge), on which he worked from 1778 to 1782. Gaucher was also a writer on theory and wrote several articles on engravers for the Abbé de Fontenai's Dictionnaire des artistes as well as obituaries of Lebas and Jean-Jacques Flipart for the Journal de Paris and several polemical writings in defence of engraving. The Académie des Sciences asked him to write a treatise on the art of engraving; he abandoned this at the onset of the French Revolution, and only his Essai sur l'origine et les avantages de la gravure (1798) gives some idea of it.

36487,Peter Paul Rubens,1577,1640,"Flemish painter who was the greatest exponent of Baroque painting's dynamism, vitality, and sensuous exuberance. His work is a fusion of the traditions of Flemish realism with the classical tendencies of the Italian Renaissance. Though his masterpieces include portraits and landscapes, Rubens is perhaps best known for his religious and mythological compositions. Early life Although Rubens' father, Jan, was born a Roman Catholic, his name had appeared on a list of Calvinists as early as 1566. This accounted for the Rubens family's exile to Germany, where Peter Paul was born. Jan Rubens became a diplomatic agent and adviser to the Protestant princess Anna of Saxony (d. 1577), second wife of William the Silent, who led the resistance to Spanish rule of the Netherlands. An unfortunate pregnancy revealed the intimate extent of the relationship between this princess of the house of Orange-Nassau and Rubens' father. She obtained clemency from her husband for Jan, but he and his family were placed under house arrest at Siegen, a Nassau stronghold in Westphalia. The Rubens children were grounded in the classics by their exiled father, who was a doctor of both civil and canon law. Jan died in 1587, after he had been allowed to go to the German city of Cologne. Rubens' mother then took her four surviving children to Antwerp, where Jan had been an alderman. Antwerp training At the age of 10, Peter Paul was sent with his brother Philip to a Latin school in Antwerp. In 1590, shortage of money and the need to provide a dowry for his sister Blandina forced Rubens' mother to break off his formal education and send him as a page to the Countess of Lalaing. Soon tired of courtly life, Rubens was allowed to become a painter. He was sent first to his kinsman Tobias Verhaecht, a minor painter of Mannerist landscapes. Having quickly learned the rudiments of his profession, he was apprenticed for four years to an abler master, Adam van Noort, and subsequently to Otto van Veen, one of the most distinguished of the Antwerp Romanists, a group of Flemish artists who had gone to Rome to study the art of antiquity and the Italian Renaissance. Italian period In May 1600, with two years' seniority as a master in the Antwerp Guild of St Luke, Rubens set out with Deodatus del Monte, his constant traveling companion and first pupil, for the visual and spiritual adventure of Italy. He was offered employment by Vincenzo I Gonzaga, Duke of Mantua, which duchy held one of the largest and finest collections outside the Vatican of works by Italian artists. During the eight years that Rubens was to call Vincenzo his lord, he had unmatched opportunities for fulfilling his expressed intention ""to study at close quarters the works of the ancient and modern masters. . . ."" Rubens was sent to Rome (1601-02) by the duke to paint copies of pictures and to live under the protection of Cardinal Montalto. There, through Flemish connections, he obtained his first public commission, to paint three altarpieces for the crypt chapel of St Helena in Santa Croce in Gerusalemme. In Rome the Bolognese painter Annibale Carracci and his assistants were at work in the gallery of the Palazzo Farnese. Their bold scale in drawing and working methods decidedly influenced the young Rubens. He assimilated Venetian colour, light, and loose application of paint first through the works of Tintoretto, then through those of Veronese, long before he could penetrate the inward meaning of Titian's art. Rubens' copies, and his reworking of drawings, offer the most complete survey of the achievement of 16th-century Italian art in a markedly personal revision. In 1603 he was entrusted with his first diplomatic mission, to take costly presents from Mantua to Philip III and the Spanish court. This mission gave him a first view of the royal collections in Madrid. His resourcefulness and tact in dealing with the temperamental regular Mantuan representative to the Spanish court raised him in the duke's estimation and helped prepare him for future diplomatic missions. The only major works he executed for Mantua were the three pictures finished in 1605 for the Jesuit Church of SS. Trinità: The Baptism of Christ (Royal Museum of Fine Arts, Antwerp), The Transfiguration (Fine Arts Museum, Nancy), and The Gonzaga Family in Adoration of the Most Holy Trinity (Ducal Palace, Mantua). In the same year he completed the Circumcision for the high altar of the Jesuit Church of Sant' Ambrogio in Genoa. Portraits of court beauties by Rubens were commissioned by the duke for the Gonzaga Gallery, of which Rubens was curator. Toward the end of 1605, Rubens obtained leave from the Duke of Mantua to continue his studies in Rome. There he shared a house with his brother Philip, then librarian to Cardinal Ascanio Colonna, a member of one of Rome's most wealthy and powerful families. Daily contact with Philip, a brilliant student of the famed Flemish humanist and classical scholar Justus Lipsius, added zest to his personal discovery of the antique world. In the summer of 1607 Rubens was asked to accompany the Gonzaga court to the Italian seaside resort of San Pier d'Arena, where he continued to paint with splendour portraits of the Genoese aristocracy. Chronic arrears in payment of his salary, and an ambition to establish himself as an international, rather than just a Mantuan, artist, motivated him to accept other patronage. He received the backing of the wealthy Genoese banker to the papacy, Monsignor Jacopo Serra, who was instrumental in obtaining for him the coveted commission for the painting over the high altar of the Roman Church of Santa Maria in Vallicella. He concurrently painted the altarpiece of the Adoration of the Shepherds for the Oratorian Order in Fermo. In October 1608 his brother summoned him to their mother's deathbed in Antwerp, but she died before he could reach her. Italy had become Rubens's spiritual home (he usually signed himself Pietro Pauolo') and he considered returning for good, but his success in Antwerp was so immediate and great that he remained there, and in spite of his extensive travels later in his career he never saw Italy again. Return to Antwerp Soon after his mother's death Rubens was ""bound with golden fetters"" to the service of the Spanish Habsburg regents of Flanders. The house that he built for himself, the pride of Antwerp, was filled with paintings, statuary, cameos, coins, and jewels from Renaissance and ancient Roman Italy. He built a private pantheon to house his antiquities. His biggest commission in Flanders was for the decoration of the Jesuit Church St Charles Borromeo in Antwerp (a building he may also have had a hand in designing). He was also the master decorator for its interior and provided oil sketches as designs for the ceiling paintings, on which he was assisted by his most talented pupil, Anthony Van Dyck, and others. Almost all his work there was destroyed by fire in 1718. Settling permanently in Flanders, Rubens in October 1609 married Isabella, daughter of Jan Brant, a leading Antwerp humanist. He became not only the court portraitist but a major religious painter. His Baroque altarpieces of The Raising of the Cross (1610) for St. Walburga's in Antwerp and the Descent from the Cross (1611-14) for Antwerp Cathedral established Rubens as the leading painter of Flanders. Because of his prestige, he was allowed to live in Antwerp, rather than in Brussels, where the Flemish court was based. Rubens' international reputation spread partly because of the large number of works produced in his workshop, which came to employ a great number of assistants and apprentices. Many of the large-scale pictures that issued from his studio were in fact painted by these assistants, though the underlying design and certain key areas of paint were done by Rubens himself. To present models of prospective large-scale paintings to clients, Rubens might also sketch out the design beforehand in tones of brown, gray, and white on a small prepared wooden panel only inches high. The demand for Rubens's work was extraordinary, and he was able to meet it only because he ran an extremely efficient studio. It is not known how many pupils or assistants he had because as court painter he was exempt from registering them with the guild. The idea of his running a sort of picture factory has been exaggerated, but even a man of his seemingly inexhaustible intellectual and physical stamina (he habitually rose at 4 a.m.) could not carry out all the work involved in his massive output with his own hands. Rubens both collaborated with established artists ('Velvet' Brueghel, van Dyck, Jordaens, Daniel Seghers, Snyders, and others) and retouched pictures by pupils, the degree of his intervention being reflected in the price. Generally his assistants did much of the work between the initial oil sketch and the master's finishing touches. Modern taste has tended to admire these sketches and his drawings (in which his personal touch is evident in every stroke of brush, chalk, or pen) more than the large-scale works, but Rubens himself would surely have found this attitude hard to comprehend, for the sheer scale and grandeur of the finished paintings gives them an extra, symphonic dimension. Among Rubens' major works from the second decade of the century are the religious paintings The Last Judgment (c. 1616; Alte Pinakothek, Munich) and Christ on the Cross (1620; Royal Museum of Fine Arts, Brussels) and the mythological paintings Battle of the Amazons (c. 1618; Alte Pinakothek) and Rape of the Daughters of Leucippus (c. 1617-18; Alte Pinakothek). His pictures of wild animals culminated in the Hippopotamus Hunt (c. 1615-16; Alte Pinakothek) and similar hunting scenes. Diplomatic career In the period between 1621 and 1630, Rubens was increasingly used as a diplomat by the Spanish Habsburg rulers. His contact with the leading political and intellectual figures of Europe, as well as his gracious manner, made him the ideal political agent. Furthermore, as a painter, he could often act as a covert diplomat or observer. His first important diplomatic functions were in connection with the attempt of Spain to renegotiate the Twelve Years' Truce (1609-21) between the Habsburg-controlled area of Flanders and the Dutch Republic to the north. Rubens became an adviser to Archduchess Isabella, the regent of Flanders and daughter of the Habsburg ruler of Spain, Philip II. On her behalf Rubens tried to intercede with the Dutch, but war soon broke out again in the Netherlands between the Protestant Dutch and the Catholic Flemish and continued for the rest of Rubens' life. Early in 1622 Rubens was summoned to Paris by Marie de Médicis, the widow of Henry IV and mother of the reigning king of France, Louis XIII. This Florentine princess, whose wedding by proxy Rubens had attended in Florence in 1600, commissioned him to paint two series of paintings for two long galleries in her newly constructed Luxembourg Palace. One cycle of 21 pictures representing episodes from Marie's life now hangs in the Louvre Museum, while the other proposed series of pictures, dealing with the life of Henry IV, was never completed. After six weeks of discussion and arrangements, Rubens returned to Antwerp, where he worked for two years on this, his most artistically important secular commission. He returned to Paris in 1625 to install the Marie de Médicis pictures. In 1628 Rubens traveled to Madrid, where he tried to lay the groundwork for peace negotiations between Spain and England. There he was made an envoy by King Philip IV and sent on a special peace mission to Charles I of England in 1629. It is to Rubens' personal diplomacy that the peace treaty of 1630 between England and Spain can largely be attributed. In reward for his services he was knighted and given an honorary degree by Cambridge University. Charles I also commissioned him to decorate the ceiling of the royal Banqueting House (1619-22) designed by the court architect Inigo Jones as a part of Whitehall Palace. Finished in 1634, the nine huge panels allegorize the reign of James I, the father of Charles I. Late years in Flanders On his return to Flanders in 1630, Rubens was rewarded by the archduchess with exemption from further diplomatic missions. The peace Rubens had worked for nearly 10 years to achieve, however, did not last, and for most of the next 20 years Europe continued to be embroiled in the Thirty Years' War. Having been a widower for four years, Rubens in 1630 married the 16-year-old Hélèna Fourment, whose charms recur frequently in such late figure paintings as The Garden of Love (1634; Prado Museum, Madrid), The Three Graces (c. 1638-40; Prado), and The Judgment of Paris (1638-39; Prado), as well as in Hélèna Fourment with Fur Cloak (c. 1638-40; Kunsthistoriches Museum, Vienna) and other portraits. Rubens bought the château of Elewijt in 1635, and in his last years he spent much time there depicting the rural life and scenery outside of Antwerp in such paintings as The Kermesse (c. 1636-38; Louvre Museum, Paris). His long-established interest in landscape painting reached its grandest and most emotionally romantic expression in such late works as Landscape with a Rainbow (c. 1634; The Hermitage, St. Petersburg) and Chateau de Steen (c. 1635-37; National Gallery, London). Rubens' major commission during these last years, however, was to provide for King Philip IV of Spain (the brother of the infante Ferdinand, who had succeeded Archduchess Isabella as regent of Flanders) models for about 120 scenes from the writings of the Roman poet Ovid and other classical authors to decorate the Torre de la Parada, the royal hunting lodge near Madrid. Rubens died at Antwerp in 1640 when gout, which had for months troubled his painting arm, reached his heart. Achievement Rubens was one of the most methodically assimilative and most prodigiously productive of Western artists. His abundant energy fired him to study and emulate the masters both of antiquity and of the 16th century in Rome, Venice, and Parma. His warmth of nature made him responsive to the artistic revolutions being worked by living artists, and robust powers of comprehension nourished his limitless resource in invention. He was able to infuse his own astounding vitality equally into religious and mythological paintings, portraits, and landscapes. He organized his complex compositions in vivid, dynamic designs in which limitations of form and contour are discounted in favour of a constant flow of movement. Rubens' voluptuous women may not be to the taste of modern viewers but are related to the full and opulent forms that were the ideal of womanhood during the Baroque period. The larger the scale of the undertaking the more congenial it was to Rubens' spirit. The success of his public performance as master of the greatest studio organization in Europe since Raphael's in Rome has obscured for many the personal intensity of his vision as evinced in such works as his oil sketch for All Saints (Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen, Rotterdam) and in his deeply felt study for the head of St John in the Antwerp cathedral Descent from the Cross, as well as in portraits of his family and friends and in his treatment of the mood and grandeur of landscape. Rubens' most immediate influence was on Sir Anthony Van Dyck, Jacob Jordaens, and other painters in Flanders, but artists at almost every period have responded to the force of his genius. He is a central figure in the history of Western art. Rubens' own deepest love as a painter, consummated by his second visit to Spain, was for the poetry, the control of glowing colour, and the sheer mastery in handling of oil paint that distinguish the art of Titian. In these qualities Rubens himself became supreme, whether with the brilliant play of fine brushes over the white reflecting surface of a small panel, or with masterful gestures often more than six feet long, sweeping a richly loaded brush across a huge canvas.

Rubens's influence in 17th-century Flanders was overwhelming, and it was spread elsewhere in Europe by his journeys abroad and by pictures exported from his workshop, and also through the numerous engravings he commissioned of his work. In later centuries, his influence has also been immense, perhaps most noticeably in France, where Watteau, Delacroix, and Renoir were among his greatest admirers. Because of the unrivalled variety of his work, artists as different in temperament as these three could respond to it with equal enthusiasm. "

He was influenced by Carstens and worked with the Nazarenes on the decorations of the Casino Massimo (1825-29) in Rome, choosing Dante's Inferno for his subject, but is now best known for his landscapes. They were directly descended from the heroic and ideal landscape of Poussin, but have a distinctive Romantic flavour, particularly in his paintings of mountains. "

He was educated initially in the workshop of Domenico Viola at Naples, but in 1708 he entered the school of Francesco Solimena, whose favourite pupil and most trusted collaborator he became. At first he followed closely Solimena's monumental Baroque manner, as in the frescoes (1715) in S Nicola alla Carità in Naples, but later developed a more controlled and refined style of rhythmical lines, light and airy colours and delicate psychological overtones. He employed this new style in his ten canvases of the Virtues and his vast Adoration of the Magi (all 1728; Naples, S Maria Donnaromita) and, above all, in his frescoes of the Adoration of the Magi in the apsidal dome of the church of the Nunziatella, Naples (1732; in situ). De Mura was also active as a portrait painter; his Portrait of the Artist's Wife (c. 1730; Naples, Pio Monte della Misericordia) and Self-portrait (c. 1730; Florence, Uffizi) are both very much in Solimena's manner.

He worked under Bramante on St Peter's, and eventually became architect to the building after Raphael's death in 1520. Amongst High Renaissance architects he ranks almost alongside these two contemporaries, but his style was very different - sophisticated and delicate rather than monumental and grave. In spite of his genius he had little material success, according to Vasari because of his 'retiring nature'. His greatest works - indeed the greatest secular building of the High Renaissance - is the Villa Farnesina (1508-11) in Rome. The Farnesina contains decorations by Raphael, Sebastiano del Piombo and Sodoma, as well as Peruzzi's own masterpiece in painting - the Sala delle Prospettive, a brilliant piece of feigned architectural painting that confirms early accounts of his skill in perspective and stage-design.

35561,Domenico Maggiotto,1713,1794,"Italian painter, part of a family of painters. Domenico Maggiotto belonged to the group of 18th-century Venetian artists centred round Giovanni Battista Piazzetta, whose influential late Baroque style was based more on the effects of chiaroscuro than on colour. Domenico's son Francesco Maggiotto (1738-1805) was also a painter, although of lesser importance than his father. Domenico attended the school of Giovanni Battista Piazzetta in Venice from the age of ten, and until the latter's death (1754) he was active there as an assistant. His works between 1730 and 1750 are characterized by an adherence to the expressive formulae of Piazzetta and are concentrated exclusively on genre subjects, for example Boy with a Flute (c. 1745; Venice, Ca' Rezzonico). The plasticity of form and the strong preference for chiaroscuro effects are the most obvious characteristics of his works of this period, during which he collaborated on several large canvases painted by Piazzetta, including Alexander before the Body of Darius (c. 1745-47; Venice, Ca' Rezzonico). Following the death of Piazzetta, Maggiotto, clearly disorientated by the lack of firm guidance, developed a tendency towards impersonal eclecticism. At the suggestion of Giuseppe Angeli (1712-98), he completed, in lightened tones, the altarpiece of St Nicholas and the Blessed Arcangelo Caneti (1754) for San Salvatore, Venice, which had already been roughly sketched out by Piazzetta; he also produced two of the Stations of the Cross (1755) for Santa Maria del Giglio. A certain lack of experience with works on a large scale is also apparent, particularly in the rather cold and disunited quality of such works as the altarpiece of St Bartholomew (1758-59) in San Bartolomeo at Valnogaredo, near Padua. In 1755 he was one of the founders of the Accademia di Pittura Scultura, where he would also be invited to teach. Maggiotto was active in Germany as well as in Italy. As a painter of sacred and secular subjects, he was an obsequious imitator of his master, Piazzetta, evincing an even greater tendency to chiaroscuro and a darker palette. His anecdotal and genre canvases reveal a more original style. "

34665,Giorgione,1477,1510,"Italian painter (real name Giorgio Barbarelli or Giorgio da Castelfranco), who 'from his stature and the greatness of his mind was afterwards known as Giorgione [great George]' (Vasari). He was ranked by Vasari with Leonardo da Vinci as one of the founders of modern painting. He was the first exponent in Venice of the small picture in oils, intended for private collectors rather than for churches, and frequently mysterious and evocative in subject. Giorgione's achievement in transforming the character of Venetian painting has always seemed the more remarkable in a life, terminated by the plague of 1510, that was even shorter than Raphael 's. Our knowledge of his career is confined to a few contemporary references, from the years 1506-10, and only a handful of paintings are undisputedly attributed to him, including the Castelfranco Altarpiece (in the church of San Liberate in the town of his birth), the portrait of Laura and The Three Philosophers (Vienna), and the Tempest (Venice, Accademia). Probably trained in the workshop of Giovanni Bellini, at the same time as Lorenzo Lotto and Palma Vecchio, Giorgione began his career, according to Vasari, as a specialist of small devotional Madonnas. In 1506 he shared a studio with Vincenzo Catena. Giorgione worked for private collectors, then beginning to emerge as a new class of patron, as well as for the Church, and he was also employed by the state in 1507-08 on a large canvas (since lost without trace) for the presence chamber of the Council of Ten. In 1508 he was painting frescoes on the outside of the Fondaco dei Tedeschi, near the Rialto (finished in November 1508), the headquarters of the German merchants in Venice, and Titian was also working there in a subordinate capacity. Only damaged fragments of the decorations, which were engraved in the 18th century, survive in the Accademia, Venice, but the link with Titian is important, for it seems to prove that it was Giorgione, and not Titian, who was the great innovator. The Castelfranco Altarpiece shows him to have been equally alive to central Italian art (Costa and Perugino), while the more experimental outlook of Leonardo, who visited Venice in 1500, is mentioned by Vasari as a major influence. In such later works as the Tempest, landscape itself is the main subject of the painting, and the technical potentialities of oil paint are used to suggest an atmospheric unification, with light and shade falling softly across the figures and their setting. The Laura of 1506 (her name identifiable from the laurel branch behind the sitter) is comparable in technique and colouring, and shows the new idealism of the early 16th century in the formulation of the composition and in the psychological remoteness of the image. The extraordinary confusion that has always beset the attribution of a group of major works related to Giorgione's later style is itself an indication of his pivotal position in Venetian art and his importance in the formation of Titian and Sebastiano del Piombo. The Concert Champêtre (Paris, Louvre) is disputed between Giorgione and Titian, The Judgment of Solomon is attributed to Sebastiano del Piombo, while the Sleeping Venus (Dresden) is known from a near-contemporary source to have been left partly unfinished, and completed by Titian, who later adapted the figure for his own Venus of Urbino (Florence, Uffizi) of 1538.

36822,Gilbert Stuart,1755,1828,"American portrait painter. With Copley he was the outstanding American portraitist of his period and he is regarded as the creator of a distinctively American style of portraiture. Much of his early career was spent in Scotland (c. 1771-72). England (1775-87), and Ireland (1787-92). After he settled permanently in America in 1792, he worked briefly in New York City, then moved to Philadelphia, and finally settled in Boston in 1805. He quickly established himself as the outstanding portraitist in the country and painted many of the notables of the new republic. His portraits of George Washington are his most famous works - he created three types, all of which were endlessly copied: the 'Vaughan' type (National Gallery of Art, Washington, 1795), the 'Lansdowne' type (Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts, Philadelphia, 1796), and the 'Athenaeum' type (Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, 1796), which is one of the most famous images in American art, being used on the country's one-dollar bill. Stuart's style is notable for its strength of characterization (Benjamin West said he 'nails the face to the canvas') and its fluent brushwork. His work had great influence on the next generation of American painters. "

35218,Angelica Kauffmann,1741,1807,"Angelica (Maria Anna Catharina) Kauffmann was a Swiss painter in the early Neoclassical style who is best known for her decorative wall paintings for residences designed by Robert Adam. The daughter of Johann Joseph Kauffmann, a painter, Angelica was a precocious child and a talented musician and painter by her 12th year. Her early paintings were influenced by the French Rococo works of Henri Gravelot and François Boucher. In 1754 and 1763 she visited Italy, and while in Rome she was influenced by the Neoclassicism of Anton Raphael Mengs. She was induced by Lady Wentworth, wife of the English ambassador, to accompany her to London in 1766. She was well received and was particularly favoured by the royal family. Sir Joshua Reynolds became a close friend, and most of the numerous portraits and self-portraits done in her English period were influenced by his style of portrait painting. Her name is found among the signatories to the petition for the establishment of the Royal Academy, and in its first catalogue of 1769 she is listed as a member. During the 1770s Kauffmann was one of a team of artists who supplied the painted decorations for Adam-designed interiors (e.g., the house at 20 Portman Square, London; now the Courtauld Institute Galleries). Kauffmann retired to Rome in the early 1780s with her second husband, the Venetian painter Antonio Zucchi. Kauffmann's pastoral and mythological compositions portray gods and goddesses in a delicate and graceful if somewhat insipid fashion. Her paintings are Rococo in tone and approach, though her figures are given Neoclassical poses and draperies. Kauffmann's portraits of female sitters are among her finest works. "

16578,Master of the Housebook,,,"Master of the Housebook (or Meister des Hausbuchs) was a Rhenish or Dutch painter, draughtsman, and engraver active in the last quarter of the 15th century. He is named from a series of drawings in the so-called Hausbuch in Schloss Wolfegg in south-west Germany; many of the drawings show scenes of everyday life and so do the engravings (about ninety are known) attributed to him. By far the best collection of the engravings is in Amsterdam Print Room, and he was therefore once known as the Master of the Amsterdam Cabinet. Because of this, and because he seems to fit into the Bosch-Bruegel tradition, he is often thought to have been Dutch and various identifications have been suggested: the latest is Erhard Reuwich, who worked on the Middle Rhine c. 1480. A few paintings are also ascribed to the Housebook Master, including the Pair of Lovers (Gotha) and one in Mainz, dated 1505, but perhaps finished by another hand. Other paintings are in Berlin and Frankfurt (Städel), but his work as an engraver was historically far more important."

He entered the studio of François Picot at the Paris Beaux-Arts in 1846. He was a friend of Théodore Chassériau, whom he frequented from 1850 until the latter's death in 1856. From 1857 to 1859 he travelled in Italy. He won considerable reputation at the 1864 Salon with his Oedipus and the Sphinx, one of his first symbolist paintings. His unfavourable critical reception in 1869 meant that he returned to the Salon only in 1876 with his Salome Dancing Before Herod, which was admired by many critics, notably Huysmans. He made many variations on the theme of Salome. Over his lifetime, he produced over 8.000 paintings, watercolours and drawings, many of which are on display in the Musée national Gustave-Moreau, Paris. In 1884 succeeded Elie Delauney as a teacher at the Beaux-Arts. Matisse, Marquet, Camoin and Roualt were among his students and their works show his influence. "

40924,Paris Bordone,1500,1571,"Italian painter. He was from Treviso, but by 1518 he had settled in Venice. Vasari says he was a pupil of Titian, but found his teaching disagreeable and soon left (Titian is then said to have stolen his first commission). Whatever the truth of these stories, Bordone's work was certainly strongly influenced by Titian and also by Giorgione, 'for that master's style pleased him exceedingly' (Vasari). He painted Giorgionesque pastoral scenes and mythologies that now seem rather hard and conventional compared with their inspiration, but they won him great popularity. Commissions came from patrons all over Europe, and he visited France and Germany. His most impressive work is generally agreed to be The Presentation of the Ring of St Mark to the Doge (Accademia, Venice, c.1535), a large ceremonial composition in Titian's grand manner. "

After being trained in Copenhagen and studying in Paris (1810-13) under Jacques-Louis David, he continued his studies in Rome (1814), where he executed a masterly portrait of his friend Thorvaldsen (Royal Academy, Copenhagen, 1815). Returning to Copenhagen in 1816, he occupied himself mainly with portraits, minutely rendering the features of his models with a Neoclassic feeling for c1arity and purity of line. He also painted many landscapes, however (as he had done in Rome), and as an influential teacher at the Copenhagen Academy (from 1818) he introduced painting from nature into the curriculum. He also executed some religious themes and subjects from Danish history in Christiansborg Palace. His pupils included Johan Christian Dahl and Christen Købke. He has been called 'the father of Danish painting' because of the influence he exerted on Danish painters in the second quarter of the 19th century. With Christen Købke he was the leading painter of the Danish 'Golden Age' (c. 1800-1850). "

Subsequently he made two visits to England, in 1809, when he studied with West, and in 1837-38, to paint Queen Victoria for the St George Society of Philadelphia (a preliminary version is in the Wallace Collection, London). His style, distinguished by fluid, glossy brushwork and romantic warmth and dash, reveals his great admiration for Lawrence. In his later work, however, he tended towards a genteel sentimentality. Sully was highly successful and extremely productive. He is said to have painted some 2,000 portraits (he also made miniatures), but his best-known work is probably one of his (also very numerous) history paintings - Washington Crossing the Delaware (Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, 1819).

34761,Francesco Guardi,1712,1793,"Italian painter, the best-known member of a family of artists. He is now famous for his views of Venice, indeed next to Canaletto he is the most celebrated view painter of the 18th century, but he produced work on a great variety of subjects and seems to have concentrated on views only after the death of his brother Gianantonio (1699-1760). Until then Francesco's personality was largely submerged in the family studio, of which Gianantonio was head and which handled commissions of every kind. The last of the great Venetian vedutisti, Francesco Guardi has achieved recognition only in the 20th century. In comparison to Canaletto and Bellotto, Guardi distinguished himself by a very liberal concept of the cityscape. He did not strive to represent each object accurately and minutely, choosing instead to emphasize the general mood and atmosphere of the scene. This holds true not only for his capriccios, but also for his cityscapes. This subjective approach held out little appeal for those who bought vedute in the eighteenth century, a substantial number of whom were foreigners and preferred the exact, almost photographic views of Canaletto and Bellotto. It was only much later that Guardi's painterly qualities came to be valued. Francesco Guardi came from a family of painters. His father and his brothers Gian Antonio and Niccolò practiced the profession. His sister Maria Cecilia married the famous Venetian history painter Giovanni Battista Tiepolo in 1719. Francesco did not learn the profession from his father, who had died when the boy was four years old, but possibly in the studio of his thirteen-year-older brother Gian Antonio. Together with his brother Francesco set up a family studio probably in the early 1730s. Only recently there is some clarity about the oeuvre of Gian Antonio. Whereas solely history paintings are attributed to Gian Antonio, Francesco devoted himself, in any case from the end of the 1750s, to painting townscapes and capriccios. Concerning the life of Francesco Guardi there is little documentation available. Most of the large number of paintings attributed to him can not be dated with certainty. There has accordingly been a good deal of speculation on questions of chronology and stylistic development in his work, one contentious area being the precise moment at which Francesco began painting veduta, and his motives for doing so. Given the fact that the first year Guardi's name appears in the registers of the Venetian painters guild is 1761, it has been assumed that he took over the leadership of the family studio following the death of Gian Antonio the previous year, and that this period also witnessed his first incursions into the genre of cityscapes. It would appear more plausible that, alongside history pieces, Francesco also executed town views in his elder brother's studio. Vedute by Guardi's hand cannot, however, be dated before the second half of the 1750s. Since the first monograph on Francesco Guardi in 1904, Guardi was thought to have been a pupil of Canaletto. Nowadays it is generally assumed that Guardi did not actually study with Canaletto, but only learned to paint vedute after the old masters death by imitating the latter's works. On the basis of a signed and dated painting from 1756 one scholar recently hypothesized that in his earliest vedute Guardi based himself on the style of Canaletto's work from the same time. This painting shows a carefully constructed compositional scheme with a highly exaggerated perspective, powerful light and colour effects and figures which are assigned a subordinate, purely decorative role. If this was indeed one of Guardi's earliest vedute, the painter did not follow Canaletto's late style for long; a number of works that can be dated approximately 1760 are characterized by a dark palette, turbulent skies and a charged atmosphere, characteristics that are far more reminiscent of Canaletto's views of the 1720s and 1730s. In the 1760s Guardi introduced the Venetian Lagoon as a theme in view painting. Lagoon views and capriccios based on them were to remain an important part of his work. In the same decade his style underwent a change that was primarily expressed in a new preference for stark contrasts of light and shade. Canaletto's work would remain important to Guardi, however, as regards the subject-matter and composition of his town views. Guardi not infrequently took as his point of departure compositions or individual motifs from the paintings of Canaletto or from prints after his work. Guardi produced his most personal work in the last twenty years of his life. Every attempt to reproduce the cityscape exactly has been abandoned. Linear perspective, that rules supreme in the work of Canaletto and above all that of Bellotto, has no more than a subordinate role with Guardi; depth is suggested by atmospheric effects. Despite the subjectivity of Guardi's approach, his paintings, no less than those of the two older painters, are also illustrations of a Venetian reality. The city is admittedly not depicted with a view to accuracy, but through the use of transparent colour and through the nervous brushwork a shimmering atmosphere is reproduced, creating an authentic image of the specific mood and the unique character of Venice. Several of the limited number of paintings by Francesco Guardi that can be dated securely belong to this period; these include the series commemorating the visit paid to Venice by the Russian prince Paulus Petrovitz and his consort in 1782 - the so-called 'conti del nord' - and the series with which Guardi recorded Pope Pius VI's visit to Venice in the same year. The series depicting the papal visit is exceptional in Guardi's oeuvre, because it is the only known commission in which the artist's instructions were set down in a contract. Other paintings that can definitely be assigned to this late period include several representations of the fire in San Marcuola which occurred in 1789. Guardi continued to paint vedute and capriccios until late in life, but neither fame nor fortune ensued. Whereas Gian Antonio Guardi, as a history painter, was one of the founders of the Venetian Accademia, his younger brother Francesco was not admitted as a pittore prospettico until 1784, at the age of seventy-one. His public consisted not so much of foreign residents of Venice and tourists, for whom for example Canaletto did a great deal of work, but rather of a group of intellectuals and clergy from the middle classes of Venetian society. Guardi died on 1 January 1792. Until the nineteenth century his son Giacomo, who took over the studio, continued producing town views in the style of his father. Indeed, so successful was Giacomo at imitating his father that where several works are concerned, the last word on attribution has not yet been spoken. "

His mother’s family was influential in Florence and proved very important for Ferretti by helping his career. In the first years of his life he lived in Imola, where he was sent to study (1708) with the local painter Francesco Chiusuri. After the family moved to Florence, Ferretti was taught there by Tommaso Redi and Sebastiano Galeotti. Later he spent five years in Bologna, an important centre for the practice and teaching of academic painting, where he absorbed that city's well-known style of studying and drawing from nature. His work acquired its characteristic style in Bologna, in the workshop of Felice Torelli. Returning to Florence in 1715, Ferretti soon joined the Accademia del Disegno, where he later taught painting and served as Console, a post he retained almost until his death. From about 1728, he designed tapestries for the grand duke of Tuscany's tapestry workshop. He began incorporating elements of Venetian artist Sebastiano Ricci's airy manner, which had inspired Florentine artists since Ricci's 1706 visit to the city. By the 1730s Ferretti was building a large workshop that gained fame in Florence and beyond. Outstanding for their complexity and monumentality, his frescoes in a Pistoia church transformed the solidity of his Bolognese-influenced style into a light and elegant manner via Ricci's art. He died while working on frescoes in a Florence church. "

He was the eldest son of the Elector's head forester, Wolfgang Dillis, and godson of Maximilian III Joseph, Electoral Prince of Bavaria, who paid for him to attend the Gymnasium in Munich. In 1782, after studying theology in Ingolstadt, Dillis became a pupil of Ignaz Oefele (1721-1797) and Johann Jakob Dorner the Elder (1741-1813) at the Munich Zeichnungsakademie, supporting himself by giving drawing lessons to the children of noble families. His earliest surviving drawings from the 1770s (Munich, Stadtarchiv and Stadtmuseum) show villages around Munich. This evident gift for landscape was encouraged by Benjamin Thompson, Count Rumford (1753-1814), an American who worked for the Bavarian Elector and created the Englischer Garten in Munich. He commissioned Dillis to make drawings of the most interesting areas in the Bavarian mountains (almost all Munich, Staatliche Graphische Sammlung and Schloss Nymphenburg). Through Rumford, Dillis was able to accompany Henry Temple, 2nd Viscount Palmerston, and his family to Salzburg in 1794. Following this, Dillis made the first of many journeys to Italy (1794-95). In addition to his contact with English culture through Rumford, Dillis widened his knowledge of art on journeys to Prague, Dresden and Vienna (1792), Rome (1805) and Paris (1806). Even though he studied theology and philosophy, Dillis was an important visual artist. As early as 1800 he was making oil sketches and watercolours from nature for private use, presaging what was to be an important 19th century art development. Although his early paintings, most specifically his Italian landscapes, still stick to late Baroque compositional schemes, he later freed himself from the guidelines of idealistic theory and painted distinctive landscapes, which were true to nature.

10052,Jan Gossart,1473,1536,"Jan Gossart (Gossaert), called Mabuse, Flemish painter, draughtsman and engraver. He was born in 1478, most probably Maubeuge (now in France) in the Burgundian province of Hainaut. It was under the name ""Jennyn Van Henegouwe"" (John of Hainaut) that he was received as a master of the Guild of St Luke at Antwerp in 1503. We do not know where he was apprenticed, and his early career is largely obscure. The composition and nature of certain of his religious paintings suggest he may have trained in Bruges, perhaps with Gérard David. But he also seem to have been one of the first representatives of what we may call Antwerp mannerism, as can be seen in his signed drawing, The Mystic Marriage of St Catherine. In 1508, Gossart travelled with Philip of Burgundy, the admiral of Zeeland, whom Margaret of Austria had sent to Rome as her envoy to Pope Julius II. They interrupted their journey to visit Trento, Verona, Mantua and Florence, where Gossart discovered the luminous art of the Quattrocento, and the splendours of classical Antiquity. On his return, he continued to study and paint for several years (1509-1516), without being able to make full use of his Italian discoveries. During this period, he received many commissions on religious subjects, for which he drew on the iconographical and technical resources of the Flemish tradition, the inventions of the Italian Renaissance, and the inspirational example of Dürer. His Agony in the Garden is one of the first northern nocturnes, and its violent intensity owes something to both Dürer and Mantegna. When he moved to Souburg at the end of 1515, Gossart finally found the place where he could express himself as an artist of the Renaissance and fully exploit his experience in Rome. There he was encouraged by the prince and humanist Philip of Burgundy, who drew him into his plan to construct an Italian-style palace decorated with figures from classical mythology. It was thus that Gossart came to paint life-size secular nudes, a subject for which there was no precedent in the former provinces of Burgundian Flanders. As Guicciardini was to say, in 1567: 'John of Hainaut was the first to bring the art of representing historical and poetical subjects with nude figures from Italy to the countries of the North."" The following year, Gossart, following Philip of Burgundy's instructions, decorated Ferdinand the Catholic's funeral hearse with nude figures and martial trophies in the classical vein. And later, in 1527, he painted Danaë, one final work on a mythological subject, a large-scale work, using sober and elegant architectural motifs as the setting for its subject. Gossart always devoted much of his time to drawing. He was particularly attracted to pen and ink drawing, more so than to drawing in pencil. His oeuvre includes many projects for engravings, paintings and stained glass windows. Dürer was always his master in this domain, and it was apparently Dürer's stay in the Netherlands in 1520 and the consequent diffusion of his prints, that inspired Gossart to make his prints: two with burin, one etching and two woodblock prints. Gossart also painted many portraits. By their rigorous psychological analysis he is surely one of the most talented northern artists to have practised this genre. Among his finest works in this respect are probably the Man with Rosary and The Elderly Couple, in the National Gallery, London, along with The Children of Christian II of Denmark. Usually, he would paint his sitters against a dark background. After 1525, he began to use a slab of coloured marble as backdrop, and provide a trompe-l'oeil frame of the kind that can be seen in certain Florentine portraits. Gossart's art was intensely personal and innovative. Although it had virtually no impact on his contemporaries, it was to profoundly influence the subsequent generation of painters. After his death in 1532, his fame began to spread through Italy, and during the 17th and 18th centuries he was also considered a major artist in the Southern Netherlands, despite the many transformations that the art of the North was about to undergo.

Malvasia mentioned his training in the Carracci Academy in Bologna, which ended c. 1594 when Faccini, envious of Annibale Carracci's rapid success, opened his own school. Until his last works, Faccini remained basically faithful to the tenets of the Carracci, and, gradually adding ideas gathered in diverse artistic circles, he developed a language of his own, characterized by great formal freedom and a lively, full-bodied use of colour. In 1590, he painted the Martyrdom of Saint Lawrence, now found in the church of San Giovanni in Monte, Bologna. He completed altarpieces for San Domenico and Santa Maria dei Servi in 1593-1594 and a Presepio, now in the Pinacoteca of Bologna. "

14713,Thomas Landseer,1795,1880,"English printmaker and writer, part of a family of artists. He was the eldest of the fourteen children of engraver John Landseer (c. 1769-1852). Seven of the children survived to adulthood and all became artists; his younger brothers were painters and later Royal Academicians Charles Landseer and Edwin Landseer. Like his siblings, Landseer was taught artistic techniques by his father. He then studied under painter Benjamin Robert Haydon alongside his brother Charles. He began etching aged 14, copying his precocious brother's drawings. Thomas continued to make etched copies of Edwin's works in later life. His soft-ground etchings complimented his brother's animal paintings, and sales of the popular prints (retailing for between 3 and 10 guineas) contributed to his brother's fame and fortune. He assisted his brother with giving art lessons to Queen Victoria and Prince Albert. Landseer became one of the most gifted and innovative engravers of his generation, being particularly adept in the use of textural etching. This type of rendering was wonderfully suited for reproducing the works of his brother Edwin's paintings. Landseer produced satirical etchings of monkeys in human clothing for Monkeyana, or, Men in Miniature (1827), and dedicated his Characteristic Sketches of Animals (1832) to the Zoological Society. He also produced illustrations for Samuel Taylor Coleridge's Devil's Walk (1831). He also exhibited paintings at the British Institution and the Royal Academy. He was elected an associate of the Royal Academy in 1867 for his etchings. He was the only sibling to marry. His son George Landseer (c. 1834-1878) became a portrait and landscape painter. "

33876,Lodovico Carracci,1555,1619,"The Carracci was a family of Bolognese painters, the brothers Agostino (1557-1602) and Annibale (1560-1609) and their cousin Lodovico (1555-1619), who were prominent figures at the end of the 16th century in the movement against the prevailing Mannerist artificiality of Italian painting. They worked together early in their careers, and it is not easy to distinguish their shares in, for example, the cycle of frescos in the Palazzo Fava in Bologna (c.1583-84). Lodovico was by temperament a fairly shy person who never found real success, unlike his cousin Annibale. Apart from traveling when young in the course of his studies and a brief and rather unpleasant stay in Rome, he spent all his life in the cosy atmosphere of Bologna, where most of his work still remains. He nevertheless has to be recognized as the first painter systematically to abandon the late Mannerist style in favour of a new kind of moral and devotional style of painting. By interpreting the suggestions made by Cardinal Paleotti, who had a special interest in the reform of religious art, Lodovico Carracci took an early lead in its renewal. This was arrived at by reassessing nature exactly as it is, even when it appears plain or uninteresting, but without ever resorting to the cerebral ploys used by the last of the Mannerists. To achieve his aim, as well as painting, Lodovico placed great emphasis on teaching. In the 1580s, he and his two cousins Annibale and Agostino opened their ""Accademia dei Desiderosi"" (The Academy of those who wish to make Progress). This was later renamed ""Academia degli Incamminati"" (The Academy of those who are making Progress) but later still was known simply as the Carracci Academy. This was responsible for shaping a whole generation of Emilian painters. Proof of how united the group was came when the three Carracci cousins together painted the frescos in Palazzo Fava. The simplicity of their compositions recalls Federico Barocci's style while the sweetness of their expression is reminiscent of Correggio. Lodovico left Bologna only for brief periods and directed the Carracci academy by himself after his cousins had gone to Rome. His work is uneven and highly personal. Painterly and expressive considerations always outweigh those of stability and calm Classicism in his work, and at its best there is a passionate and poetic quality indicative of his preference for Tintoretto and Jacopo Bassano. His most fruitful period was 1585-95, but near the end of his career he still produced remarkable paintings of an almost Expressionist force, such as the Christ Crucified above Figures in Limbo (Sta Francesca Romana, Ferrara, 1614). Lodovico's own sensitivity derived from his deep knowledge of Venetian painting. His style was composed of delicate gestures, bashful looks, and a good deal of narrative drama. Especially in his medium to small pictures this readily became lyrical poetry. Among his most important works we should mention his youthful Annunciation and his noble Madonna dei Bargellini (both in the Pinacoteca Nazionale in Bologna). Later on he painted the frescos in the cloisters of S. Michele in Bosco, near Bologna (1604). After his cousins' deaths he produced some large and rather sad compositions, such as The Funeral of the Madonna in the Parma Galleria Nazionale and the fresco of the Annunciation on the triumphal arch in the Metropolitan church of S. Pietro in Bologna, finished the year he died. "

41499,Sebastiano del Piombo,1480,1547,"Sebastiano del Piombo (originally Sebastiano Luciani), Venetian painter, active mainly in Rome. According to Vasari, he trained with Giovanni Bellini, but his early work was most strongly influenced by Giorgione, whose Three Philosophers (Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna) Sebastiano is said to have completed after the master's death. Their styles, indeed, can be so close as to cause paintings to be disputed between them, most notably the unfinished Judgment of Solomon (National Trust, Kingston Lacy). This large and impressive work was attributed to Giorgione by Ridolfi, but scholarly opinion now increasingly tends towards giving it to Sebastiano. The half-length Salome (or Judith?) (National Gallery, London, 1510) shows the magnificent painterly skills of an undoubted work of Sebastiano at this date; it has a sensuous beauty reminiscent of Giorgione, but also a statuesque grandeur that is Sebastiano's own. In 1511 Sebastiano moved to Rome on the invitation of the banker Agostino Chigi, and he remained there for the rest of his life apart from a visit to Venice in 1528-9 after the Sack of Rome. For Chigi he painted mythological frescos at the Villa Farnesina, where Raphael also worked. It was with Michelangelo rather than Raphael, however, that Sebastiano formed a friendship and a professional relationship. Michelangelo not only recommended him to people of influence, but also made drawings for him to work from, as with The Raising of Lazarus (National Gallery, London, 1517-19). This was painted in competition with Raphael's Transfiguration (Vatican), both being intended for Narbonne Cathedral, and Vasari suggests that Michelangelo helped Sebastiano in order to discredit the Raphael faction, who had denigrated his powers as a colourist. Under Michelangelo's guidance Sebastiano's work became grander in form whilst losing much of its beauty of handling, the lack of sensuous appeal being accentuated when he began experimenting with painting on slate, as in The Flagellation (San Pietro in Montorio, Rome). Some of the finest works of Sebastiano's Roman years are his portraits, and after Raphael's death (1520) he had no rival in the city in this field, his work attaining a distinctive sombre grandeur. Clement VII (Giulio de' Medici), the subject of one of Sebastiano's finest portraits (Museo di Capodimonte, Naples, 1526), appointed him keeper of the papal seals in 1531 and after this he was less active as a painter. The seals were made of lead, 'piombo' in Italian, hence Sebastiano's nickname. "

Born into a Methodist family, he was the seventh child of a miller and baker in Feasegate, York, and in 1798 he was apprenticed as a printer to Robert Peck, publisher of the Hull Packet. Financial support from his uncle, a banker, allowed him to go to London in 1805, where he entered the Royal Academy Schools in 1806. For a year, in 1807-8, he was a pupil of Thomas Lawrence, who greatly influenced him. Following the death of his uncle in 1809 he became financially secure. From 1811 he exhibited regularly at the Royal Academy and the British Institution and in 1816 worked in the studio of Jean-Baptiste Regnault in Paris. His success was due to large history paintings. He was one of the few British artists to make a career out of this genre. The Classical or biblical subject-matter of the history works gave Etty the ideal pretext for painting the nude. During the 1830s and 1840s Etty generally concentrated on smaller, less ambitious works. In this he catered to the market, to the point that, in his later years, he risked being accused of selling out to the dealers. Throughout his career Etty painted portraits. In his later years he also produced landscape paintings. At their best his spontaneous oil sketches of landscape bear comparison with Constable's. Etty is the only major British painter before the 20th century to have devoted his career to the nude. Remarkably, his public recognition and success were achieved in the face of vitriolic censure from a press that accused him of indecency. Though famous and financially successful in his day, his reputation declined after his death and has never fully recovered. "

41476,Tommaso Conca,,1815,"Italian painter. His father was a painter and cousin to the more famous painter Sebastiano Conca; the two were Tommaso's first teachers in Baroque painting. In 1770, Tommaso was made member of Accademia di San Luca, Rome's guild of painters. From 1775 to 1782 he worked for Marcantonio Borghese, painting the ceilings of two rooms in the renovated Galleria Borghese, in collaboration with Giovanni Battista Marchetti (1730-1800). In Sala del Sileno, above a Roman statue of Silenus he set scenes from that character, along with Bacchus and his followers. In the Sala Egizia, dedicated to Egyptian sculpture, he represented the Nile, Cybele and astronomical bodies, adorning the space between them with mock Egyptian idols; on the walls he added eight scenes of Egyptian religion and the lives of Marcus Antonius and Cleopatra. Between 1782 and 1787 Conca painted Apollo and the Muses, a fresco decorating the Sala delle Muse, a room in the papal Museo Pio Clementino in Vatican. At the end of his life, he completed another fresco in the Vatican's Museo Chiaramonti, which celebrate the restitution of paintings that had been taken to Musée Napoléon. Following Anton Raphael Mengs he shifted to a Neoclassical style. One of his pupils was Camillo Guerra (1797-1874). "

Jacob studied with Andreas Lens (1739-1822) a history and figure painter in Antwerp and graduated from the Antwerp Koninklijke Academie voor Schone Kunsten in 1776. Thereafter he was encouraged by the Amsterdam collector Jan Danser Nijman. On his return to Dordrecht he became a member of the 'Pictura Drawing Society' which had been founded in 1774 by his brother, amongst others. In 1786 Jacob married Magdalene van Rijndorp, by whom he had four children. For a period from 1801 the brothers shared a studio, working together on numerous commissions for the decoration of houses in Dordrecht, such as that of Jacob Vriesendorp, now in the Dordrechts Museum. As fashionable artists of their day, they played a significant part in stimulating a revival of interest in 17th-century Dutch painters, some of whose works provided them with inspiring models for emulation and, on occasion, imitation. Jacob's landscape paintings and drawings were strongly influenced by Cuyp. "

41358,Cornelis de Wael,1592,1667,"Painter, draughtsman and dealer, part of a Flemish family of artists and dealers, active in Italy. The brothers Lucas de Wael (1591-1661) and Cornelis de Wael were the sons of the painter Jan Baptist (Hans) de Wael I (1558-1633), from whom they learnt to paint. They both went to Italy c. 1610 and by 1613 had settled in Genoa. There Cornelis founded the Cenacolo Fiammingo, where he trained many young painters. Their circle of expatriate Flemings included Anthony van Dyck, who lived with them for a time and painted a double portrait of them (c. 1627; Rome, Museo Capitolino). Cornelis received commissions from Italian churches but is best known for his military pieces, harbour views and bambocciante or low-life subjects, whereas Lucas made a name for himself as a landscape painter. Jan Baptist de Wael II is primarily known as an etcher; he may also have worked in Italy. Documentary evidence suggests that Cornelis may have collaborated with van Dyck; he may also have worked with the Italian landscape painter Giovanni Battista Vicino (fl c. 1650), since various landscapes by Vicino have figures in them by either de Wael or a painter from his circle. During visits to Rome, Cornelis came into contact with the Schildersbent, the confraternity of northern artists there, and in 1627 he was recorded in the documents of Rome's Guild of St Luke. He moved there from Genoa in 1656, following an outbreak of the plague. "
17538,Antonio Molinari,1665,1727,"Italian painter and draughtsman. Son of Giovanni Battista Molinari (1636-after 1682), a painter, he apprenticed with Antonio Zanchi in Venice. His style had its origins in the naturalism and tenebrism of Neapolitan painting, introduced to Venice in the mid-17th century. Although his work always retained some traces of this naturalism, the typically violent subject-matter and intensity of the Neapolitan style were considerably tempered by the addition of classicising elements and of rich, glowing colours. By the 1680s Molinari had developed his characteristic manner of depicting figures in poses of extreme torsion and vigorous movement, arranged in graceful compositions. His subject-matter included episodes from the Old and New Testaments, antiquity and Classical mythology. His classical idiom was most pronounced in his large canvases painted for churches, such as the Feeding of the Five Thousand (1690; San Pantalon, Venice) and the Death of Uzzah (c. 1695; Santa Maria degli Angeli in Murano). In the Death of Uzzah a long procession moves diagonally across the canvas through an Arcadian landscape, and the figures are arranged in patterns of overlapping triangles and planes of alternating light and dark.

8274,Felice Ficherelli,1603,1660,"Italian painter, called il Riposo. His most original works were easel pictures, for private collectors, often of cruel and violent subjects, which he interpreted with a morbid sensuality and ambiguous tenderness. He was brought to Florence when very young by the collector Conte Alberto Bardi (d 1632), who arranged for him to study with Jacopo da Empoli and to copy works by Andrea del Sarto. Ficherelli's clear compositions and luminous drapery, which remain evident throughout his career, reflect this training. In the early 1630s he was attracted by the delicate sfumato effects of Francesco Furini and developed a style close to that of Cecco Bravo; his works of this period include the Sacrifice of Isaac (private collection) and the Martyrdom of St Agatha (private collection). There followed in the late 1630s Tarquin and Lucretia, which is known in several versions (e.g. Rome, Accademia S. Luca), the theatrical Julia Receiving the Bloodstained Garments of Pompey (private collection), an Allegory of Patience (private collection) and Antiochus and Stratonica (Auckland, City Art Gallery). His altarpieces of the 1650s, among them the Vision of St Filippo Neri (1657-59; Florence, Certosa del Galluzzo, Pinacoteca), are his only securely dated works and return to the clarity of Empoli, while his last works, such as Lot and his Daughters (Dublin, National Gallery), are characterized by a new softness and freedom. His nickname, il Riposo, derived from his retiring nature. "
17492,Francesco Mochi,1580,1654,"Italian sculptor, strongly influenced by Florentine styles, who worked in Florence, Orvieto, Rome and Piacenza. He collaborated with Camillo Mariani at San Bernardo alle Terme in Rome. He failed to consolidate his reputation in Rome, and his employment by the Farnese family meant that he passed many of the years between 1612 and 1629 in their fiefdom of Piacenza. When he returned to Rome in 1629, Mochi was effectively marginalized by Gianlorenzo Bernini. Among numerous equestrian statues are that of Alessandro Farnese and Ranuccio Farnese at Piacenza. His religious works include the Annunciation group in Orvieto Cathedral (called the first Baroque sculpture) and St Veronica in St Peter's, Rome. "

Harry James Powell was the grandson of James Powell, founder of James Powell and Sons Glass Company (originally known as Whitefriars Glass Works) in London. The late 17th-century Whitefriars Glass Works, on the site of the Whitefriars monastery in the City of London, was bought in 1834 by a merchant James Powell (1774-1840). In 1844, his sons added a stained-glass department to cater for the growing demand for windows. In 1851, the firm was commissioned by the stained-glass specialist Charles Winston (1814-64) to re-create medieval glass through its proper chemical constituents. This 'antique' glass was produced on a large scale from 1853 and was used by many other studios. Powell's was one of the most successful Victorian firms because it had a policy of employing many distinguished artists as freelance designers. Although there was no distinctive house style, standards of design were high. Edward Burne-Jones provided cartoons from 1857 to 1861. He was succeeded in 1863 by Henry Holiday (1839-1927), whose style changed from Pre-Raphaelite to classical during his long association with the firm, which continued until 1891. By the end of the century, the firm was also producing fine tableware, paperweights and tesserae for mosaics. Twentieth-century works include windows for Liverpool Anglican Cathedral and are generally 'signed' in the border by the figure of a friar. In 1962, it became Whitefriars Glass Ltd. The stained-glass department closed in 1973 and the glassworks in 1980. Harry James Powell introduced the style and techniques of fine Venetian glass art to his company, which was to become one of the forerunners of the Arts and Crafts movement. Powell's company was one of the first to introduce Art Nouveau to glass art and, in its day, was heralded as the best glassworks in England. "

63946,Joseph Parrocel,1646,1704,"French painter, part of a family of painters and engravers. They were originally from Montbrisson in the Loire region, and they were one of the most numerous French artistic dynasties, from the 16th century producing 14 painters over 6 generations. They were most prominent in the late 17th century and the 18th. Joseph Parrocel and his son Charles Parrocel (1688-1752) were notable painters of battles and hunts. Joseph's nephew Pierre Parrocel (1670-1739) was a prolific painter of religious works, as was his nephew and pupil Etienne Parrocel (1696-1775), who spent his working life in Rome. Joseph Parrocel studied with his father Barthélemy Parrocel (?1595-1660) and then with his elder brother Louis Parrocel (1634-1694). He went to Paris for four years to perfect his work and then, c. 1667, to Rome, where he became the pupil of the battle painter Jacques Courtois and was influenced by Salvator Rosa. He remained in Italy for eight years and stayed for a time in Venice, before returning to settle in Paris in 1675. He was approved (agréé) by the Académie Royale de Peinture et de Sculpture in February 1676 and received (reçu) as a full member in November of the same year, presenting the Siege of Maastricht (Draguignan, Musée Municipal). His painted oeuvre consists principally of military scenes, particularly battles, and he received numerous royal commissions. In the period 1685-88 he executed 11 paintings for the Salle du Grand Couvert at the château of Versailles (nine in situ; one in Tours, Musée des Beaux-Arts; one in Dijon, Musée des Beaux-Arts); in 1699 he painted the Crossing of the Rhine (Paris, Musée du Louvre) for the château of Marly, Yvelines, and in 1700 he executed the Fair at Bezons (Tours, Musée des Beaux-Arts), anticipating the fêtes galantes of Antoine Watteau. He was also the author of a number of hunting scenes (e.g. Aix-en-Provence, Musée Granet). His most important religious paintings were the May of Notre-Dame de Paris of 1694, St John the Baptist Preaching (Arras, Musée des Beaux-Arts) and St Augustin Succouring the Sick (c. 1703; Nantes, Musée des Beaux-Arts), which was intended for the monastery in the Place des Victoires in Paris. He also contributed battle scenes to the backgrounds of portraits by Hyacinthe Rigaud and by Gabriel Blanchard. His technique was highly original in the context of his time; he employed a very free style of execution and used thick impasto and intense colours. He was also a prolific engraver, producing around 100 plates, among them 25 Mysteries from the Life of Jesus Christ and 40 Miracles from the Life of Our Lord Jesus Christ. Others were executed for the Missale parisiense of 1685, and some depicted military subjects. Joseph Parrocel's pupils included the landscape painter François Sylvestre (1667-1738), his son Charles Parrocel and his nephews Ignace-Jacques Parrocel (1667-1722) and Pierre Parrocel. "

91739,Theodor Esbern Philipsen,1840,1920,"Danish painter, sculptor and draughtsman. He studied at the Kongelige Akademi for de Skønne Kunster, Copenhagen, in 1862-63 and 1865-69, and in Paris under Léon Bonnat in 1875-76. He was an important figure in the development and renewal of Danish naturalism, linking the Danish Golden Age tradition with new French ideas. Conscious of the importance of plein-air painting, he was first a great admirer of the Barbizon school; later he was influenced by the Impressionists, becoming the only truly Danish Impressionist. Frequent visits abroad helped him develop his outlook; he eagerly studied the Old Masters, and the strong light of the south. Philipsen's first encounter with the French impressionists dates back to his first period in Paris from 1874 to 1876, where it is very likely that he visited the second Impressionist exhibition in 1876. Even so, during this sojourn in Paris he was most impressed by the Barbizon painters Theodore Rousseau, Constant Troyon, and perhaps especially Jean-François Millet. In fact, another six years would pass before the first traces of true Impressionist influences manifest themselves in Philipsen's work. They do so in the years 1882-84 during a prolonged sojourn abroad that first took Philipsen to Paris where he saw the seventh Impressionist exhibition at the Galerie Durand-Ruel. From Paris he went on to Andalusia, from there to Tunis in North Africa and then onwards to Rome and Sora. During this period he created a number of pictures that have accurately been described as proto-Impressionist. Philipsen cemented his links with impressionism in 1889 with his participation in the exhibition Nordic and French Impressionists. In terms of technique and renditions of light and atmosphere, Philipsen shares a kinship with Pissarro and Monet, but his originality resides in his ability to adapt and develop the Impressionist palette in accordance with the Danish countryside and weather. Philipsen is one of the most widely travelled and well-oriented Danish artists. He himself preferred to retreat from modern life, but his welcoming attitude towards young artists and open-mindedness regarding the latest arts made him a highly respected and central figure within Danish art.

8262,Francesco di Simone Ferrucci,1437,1493,"Italian sculptor, member of a family of artists. Francesco was probably trained by his father, Simone di Nanni Ferrucci (b. 1402), and was decisively influenced by Desiderio da Settignano and Andrea del Verrocchio. Vasari named him among the pupils of Verrocchio, and it is possible that in the 1470s he assisted the master. He matriculated in the Arte dei Maestri di Pietra e di Legname, the Florentine sculptors' guild, in 1463 and established a workshop in Florence in 1466. By 1470, when he first submitted a catasto (land registry declaration), he was married and owned a house in Florence. Between 1460 and 1466 Francesco was employed making decorative carvings for the Badia at Fiesole, and from 1467 to 1478 he worked with his brother Bernardo Ferrucci (b. 1447) at the convent of Santissima Annunziata, Florence. Other documents record payments to Francesco for the execution of a holy water stoup (1466) for Santa Maria in Peretola, near Florence (in situ); the carving of the tomb of Lemmo Balducci (fragments, Florence, San Egidio) for the hospital of San Matteo, Florence (probably 1471-72), of which Balducci was the founder, and five columns for an altar in the hospital (1472); the execution of an indeterminable work for Prato Cathedral (1476); architectural carving in San Petronio, Bologna (1480); the delivery of a Holy Sacrament tabernacle that he made for the Sisters of Santa Maria di Monteluce, outside Perugia (1483; in situ); and the execution of a marble ciborium on commission from Cardinal Carlo de' Medici for Prato Cathedral (1487). A single signed work by Francesco exists: the marble tomb of Alessandro Tartagni (Bologna, San Domenico), who died in 1477. This demonstrates that by the late 1470s Francesco's figure and drapery style had changed markedly under the influence of Verrocchio. A group of sheets (divided between museums in Berlin, Chantilly, Dijon, Hamburg, London, New York and Paris), for the most part of about the same size and nearly all with sketches on both sides, once known as the 'Verrocchio Sketchbook', is generally regarded as from a sketchbook by Francesco and his workshop.

36336,Odilon Redon,1840,1916,"French printmaker, draughtsman and painter. He spent his childhood at Peyrelebade, his father's estate in the Limousin region. Peyrelebade became a basic source of inspiration for all his art, providing him with both subjects from nature and a stimulus for his fantasies, and Redon returned there constantly until its enforced sale in 1897. He received his education in Bordeaux from 1851, rapidly showing talent in many art forms: he studied drawing with Stanislas Gorin (?1824-?1874) from 1855; in 1857 he attempted unsuccessfully to become an architect; and he also became an accomplished violinist. He developed a keen interest in contemporary literature, partly through the influence of Armand Clavaud, a botanist and thinker who became his friend and intellectual mentor. He learned lithography under Henri Fantin-Latour. He came to be associated with the Symbolist painters. His oils and pastels, chiefly still-lifes with flowers, won him admiration as a colourist from Henri Matisse and other painters. His prints (nearly 200 in all), which explore fantastic, often macabre themes, foreshadowed Surrealism and Dada. "

41437,Jan van Eyck,1385,1441,"Jan van Eyck, the most famous and innovative Flemish painter of the 15th century, is thought to have come from the village of Maaseyck in Limbourg. No record of his birthdate survives, but it is believed to have been about 1390; his career, however, is well documented. He was employed (1422-24) at the court of John of Bavaria, count of Holland, at The Hague, and in 1425 he was made court painter and valet de chambre to Duke Philip the Good of Burgundy. He became a close member of the duke's court and undertook several secret missions for him, including a trip (1428-29) to Spain and Portugal in connection with negotiations that resulted in the marriage (1430) of Philip of Burgundy and Isabella of Portugal. Documents show that in 1432-33 van Eyck bought a house in Bruges. He signed and dated a number of paintings between 1432 and 1439, all of which are painted in oil and varnished. According to documents, he was buried on July 9, 1441. Van Eyck has been credited traditionally with the invention of painting in oils, and, although this is incorrect, there is no doubt that he perfected the technique. He used the oil medium to represent a variety of subjects with striking realism in microscopic detail; for example, he infused painted jewels and precious metals with a glowing inner light by means of subtle glazes over the highlights. Van Eyck's most famous and most controversial work is one of his first, the Ghent altarpiece (1432), a polyptych consisting of twenty panels in the Church of St. Bavo, Ghent. On the frame is an incomplete inscription in Latin that identifies the artists of the work as Hubert and Jan van Eyck. The usual interpretation is that Hubert van Eyck (d. Sept. 18, 1426) was the brother of Jan and that he was the painter who began the altarpiece, which Jan then completed. Another interpretation is that Hubert was neither Jan's brother nor a painter, but a sculptor who carved an elaborate frame for the altar. Because of this controversy, attribution of the panels, which vary somewhat in scale and even in style, has differed, according to the arguments of scholars who have studied the problem. Equally famous is the wedding portrait of Giovanni Arnolfini and his wife (1434; National Gallery, London), which the artist signed ""Johannes de Eyck fuit hic 1434"" (Jan van Eyck was here), testimony that he witnessed the ceremony. Other important paintings are the Madonna of Chancellor Rolin (1433-34 Louvre, Paris) and the Madonna of Canon van der Paele (1436; Groeningen Museum, Bruges). "

34864,Childe Hassam,1859,1935,"American painter and printmaker who studied in Boston and Paris before settling in New York City. He was initially trained as an apprentice to a wood-engraver. From the late 1870s to the mid-1880s he executed drawings for the illustration of books, particularly children's stories. From 1898 to 1918 he exhibited together with a group of New York and Boston painters known as The Ten, who became the foremost proponents of U.S. Impressionism. Urban life was his favourite subject, but his landscapes of New England and rural New York also became popular. Paintings such as Washington Arch, Spring (1890) are characterized by clear, luminous atmosphere and brilliant colour. He also produced some 400 etchings and lithographs. With their flickering light and airy palette, Hassam's sprightly landscapes, cityscapes, and interiors show the strong influence of late 19th-century French painting, and he is probably the best known of America's impressionists. Examples of his work include many scenes on the Isles of Shoals and July 14th, Rue Daunou, 1910 (1910), The New York Window (1912), The Church at Gloucester (1918), and Fifth Avenue (1919). He also illustrated Celia Thaxter's An Island Garden (1894). An extremely prolific and popular artist, he is represented in virtually every major American museum. "

He reacted against the academic tradition on which he was trained (Cignani was one of his teachers) and specialized in genre subjects, with violent chiaroscuro effects of brilliant colour against dark backgrounds. They are in the tradition of the everyday-life paintings of the Carracci, but go far beyond them in their sense of unvarnished reality (The Hamlet, Pinacoteca, Bologna). After his early frescos in Bologna, Crespi spent a fruitful time in Florence in the opening years of the eighteenth century. Here he was able to rival Magnasco and Flemish genre painters, painting scenes of market places, kitchens, farm houses, and domestic interiors. His masterpieces are the canvases from the cycle dedicated to the Seven Sacraments (now in Dresden). In them, various scenes are interpreted in a humble and popular vein, but at the same time they retain an intimately mystical quality. Crespi was also an outstanding portrait-painter, as is demonstrated by the very witty sketch he made for a portrait of Cardinal Lambertini (Bologna, Pinacoteca Nazionale). This was modified before the final version was painted (Rome, Vatican Gallery), as the cardinal had been elected pope, under the name of Benedict XIV. He was an outstanding teacher, numbering Piazzetta and Pietro Longhi among his pupils, and he exercised a great influence on Venetian 18th century painting. Rudolf Wittkower called him 'the only real genius of the late Bolognese school'. Two of Crespi's sons, Antonio (1712-1781) and Luigi became painters. According to their account, Crespi may have used a camera obscura to aid in depiction of outdoor scenes in his later years. After his wife's death, he became reclusive, rarely leaving the house except to go to daily mass. "

9131,Anton Domenico Gabbiani,1652,1726,"Italian painter. He first trained with the Medici court portrait painter Justus Sustermans and then with the painter Vincenzo Dandini. On 20 May 1673 he arrived in Rome, where he studied for three years under Ciro Ferri and Ercole Ferrata at the Accademia Fiorentina. He responded in particular to the paintings of Pietro da Cortona and Carlo Maratti who were both to be important influences on him. Though not precocious, Gabbiani became one of the most noted painters from the Accademia. After a period in Venice (1678-79) with the portrait painter Sebastiano Bombelli, he was in Florence in 1680. By 1684, the year in which he executed an Annunciation (destroyed) for the Palazzo Pitti, he was an independent painter. His first important public commission, the St Francis de Sales in Glory (1685) for the church of Santi Apostoli, Florence (in situ), shows the influence of Maratti in its grandiose composition and that of Dandini in the treatment of figures. In Prince Ferdinando de' Medici Gabbiani found a particularly loyal patron, and he painted his portrait, Ferdinando de' Medici and his Musicians (c. 1685, Florence, Pitti). One of the works executed for Ferdinando was possibly a portrait of his sister, which Chiarini has identified with the painting of Anna Maria Luisa de' Medici (c. 1685; Florence, Pitti). Further works from this period are the group portrait of Three Musicians at Ferdinando's court and a Group of Courtiers (1685-90; Florence, Uffizi). Gabbiani's masterpiece is considered to be his ceiling frescoes for the Palazzina Meridiana, specifically in the Sala Meridiana in the Pitti Palace. This work underscores the frequent, yet somewhat ostentatious Medici patronage of arts related to science. Gabbiani's pupils included Giovanna Fratellini, Ignazio Enrico Hugford (also a biographer), Benedetto Luti, Ranieri del Pace, Giovanni Battista and Tommaso Redi. "

The sharp outlines and glossy textures of his portraits show, in particular, a kinship with Bronzino. In 1525 Pencz was expelled from Nuremberg with the Beham brothers, two other ""godless artists"", for their radical Protestant views, but the sentence was soon revoked and he returned to the city. In 1550, he was appointed painter to Duke Albrecht of Prussia, but died in the same year. "

36418,Auguste Rodin,1840,1917,"French sculptor. He began his art study at 14 in the Petite École and in the school of Antoine Barye, earning his living by working for an ornament maker. In 1863 he went to work for the architectural sculptor Albert-Ernest Carrier-Belleuse, who had a great influence on him. From 1870 to 1875 he continued in the same trade in Brussels and then briefly visited Italy. In the Salon of 1877 he exhibited a nude male figure, The Age of Bronze, which was both extravagantly praised and condemned; his critics unjustly accused him of having made a cast from life. From the furore Rodin gained the active support and patronage of Turquet, undersecretary of fine arts. His Age of Bronze and St John the Baptist were purchased for the Luxembourg Gardens, Paris. The government gave him a studio in Paris, where he worked the rest of his life with growing fame. From 1880 on Rodin worked intermittently on studies for a huge bronze door for the Musée des Arts décoratifs. It was inspired by Dante's Inferno and was to be called The Gates of Hell. He never finished it. Among the 186 figures intended for it are Adam and Eve, The Thinker, Ugolino and His Children, and The Kiss. These, together with his group The Burghers of Calais, completed in 1894, are among his most famous creations. Other ambitious works are his monuments to Balzac and to Victor Hugo. Rodin is also known for his drawings, his many fine portrait busts, and his figures and groups in marble. He is best represented in the Rodin museums of Paris and Philadelphia, but fine examples of his work are included in many public collections throughout the world. Rodin's work is generally considered the most important contribution to sculpture of his century, although some recent critical opinion has found his allegorical works pretentious. Realistic in many respects, it is nevertheless imbued with a profound, romantic poetry. The Gothic, the dance, and the works of Dante, Baudelaire, and Michelangelo were major sources of inspiration. Rodin considered his work completed when it expressed his idea, and as a result his sculpture is varied in technique; some is polished, some is gouged and scraped, and some seems scarcely to have emerged from the rough stone. He worked long over his more important works, returning to them again and again but without injuring their essential vitality. Though his works caused controversy for their unconventionality, he was successful enough that he could establish a workshop where he executed only molds, leaving the casting of bronze and the carving of marble to assistants. To his sculpture he added book illustrations, etchings, and numerous drawings, mostly of female nudes. He revitalized sculpture as an art of personal expression and has been considered one of its greatest portraitists. "

His work drew both on earlier Spanish art, especially the paintings and etchings of Goya, and on contemporary foreign works, notably the paintings of the Italian Macchiaioli and those of the French artist Ernest Meissonier. Following a stay in Morocco in 1860, his topics evolve towards Orientalist subjects. "

40621,Guercino,1591,1666,"Guercino (a nickname meaning ""the squinter"", originally Giovanni Francesco Barbieri), Italian painter of the Bolognese school. He was self-taught but developed precociously. Despite the fact that he spent much of his life in Cento, a small provincial town between Bologna and Ferrara, he managed to become one of the major artists of his day. He was early inspired by the classical reforms of Lodovico Carracci but his pictures were full of movement and intense feeling. In 1621 Pope Gregory XV summoned him to Rome where he stayed until 1623, trying to balance his own dynamic temperament with the rarefied manner of the classical school. The works he produced in Rome such as Aurora, in the Ludovisi's country house were perhaps his most original paintings. After Gregory's death in 1623, he went back to Emilia, his energy gradually seemed to dissipate and his painting became more controlled. On the death of Guido Reni (1642) he moved to Bologna where the dominant climate was coldly classical. Altering his art to suit this atmosphere, Guercino became the leader of its academic art world.

His earliest recording as a painter can be found in an Amsterdam inventory of 1614. Possibly in 1614 but probably by 1617 he had moved to Amsterdam. His teacher is unknown. There is evidence for sojourns in Paris and Northern France in 1637-1639, but not beyond. Amsterdam remained his home-base and his burial is registered there. Abraham de Verwer was a marine painter, but he also painted landscapes and townscapes. He was the father of the painter Justus de Verwer and the poetess Catharina Verwer. "

36480,Thomas Rowlandson,1756,1827,"English caricaturist, whose pre-eminence in social satire matched that of Gillray in political satire. He began as a painter, mainly of portraits, but he turned to caricature to supplement his income (he was a notorious gambler), and finding his sideline highly successful he gave his career over to it completely. His talent for exuberant and flowing line had affinities with the French Rococo of Fragonard (Rowlandson had studied in France), but his rollicking humour and delicate tonal effects were distinctively English; the marvel of his art is that there is no inconsistency between the bawdiness or boisterousness of the subject-matter and the beauty of his watercolour technique. He created an instantly recognizable gallery of social types, such as the old maid, the hackwriter and the crabbed antiquarian, and his buxom wenches have their descendants in the fat ladies of today's saucy seaside postcards. His repertory of themes was inexhaustible and his oevre has been termed the English equivalent of Balzac's Comédie humaine. He was a friend of George Morland and travelled about England and also in France, Germany, and the Low Countries making rapid and brilliantly illuminating sketches of country life. In addition he produced series of illustrative drawings for publishers, notably The Comforts of Bath (1798) and the series on The Tours of Dr Syntax (1812-20). Rowlandson's output was huge, but it was only towards the end of his career that the quality of his work suffered because of overproduction. Although he is commonly thought of as a satirist, most of his drawings are gently humorous, and in some cases objective, records of urban and rustic life. With the exception of a small number of topographical drawings, they are characterized by an abundance of picaresque incidents, whether robust or sentimental, and have much in common with the novels of Laurence Sterne and Henry Fielding, which Rowlandson illustrated in 1808 and 1809.

His early training in engraving influenced his future career; his ability to draw a fine line, lay aquatint washes and hand-colour prints was an important factor in the creation of his particularly lucid style of watercolour landscapes and townscapes. At this time Cooke was engraving volumes of picturesque views by Turner and James Hakewell (1778-1843) as well as his own view of the Thames (1822); Boys went on to establish a reputation for his own lithographed volumes of picturesque tours.

By the following year he was employed by Christoph Plantin, to whom he introduced his brother Hieronymus Wierix in 1570. At the time Jan was living in the Lombaardevest, amid many other booksellers and engravers. He worked for Plantin's publishing house, the Officina Plantiniana, more often than Hieronymus, and already in 1570 and 1571 Plantin paid Jan's drinking debts. From then onwards Jan's name appears regularly in Plantin's accounts and letters. "

He received his first lessons from his father, Johannes Hermanus Koekkoek (1778-1851), and also studied at the Tekenacademie in Middelburg. Subsequently he became a pupil at the Amsterdam Rijksakademie under Jean Augustin Daiwaille (1786-1850). He first participated in an exhibition in 1820. Between 1826 and 1834 he travelled constantly, visiting the Harz Mountains, the Rhine and the Ruhr. His first great success came in 1829 when he won the gold medal of the Amsterdam society Felix Meritis with Landscape with a Rainstorm Threatening (Amsterdam, Rijksmuseum). The painting is notable for its accurate and sober study of nature; it marked Koekkoek's commitment to a style of landscape divorced both from the predominantly topographical approach of the 18th century and from the flat and decorative manner of contemporary mural painting. Koekkoek married the artist Elize Therese Daiwaille and moved to Cleve with her in 1834. The Rhine landscape and the forests of Cleve had been held dear by artists since the 17th century and Koekkoek was also inspired by them. They matched his image of the perfect landscape and it was in Cleve that Koekkoek's style reached maturity. He painted many landscapes here ranging from extensive river valleys to forest views dominated by one or more oak trees and these works earned him great fame. The artist had many wealthy patrons from the rich merchant classes in Holland and in 1839 King Willem III bought A View of a Forest with Cattle, a large painting that was rewarded with a gold medal at the Hague Salon held that same year. The Russian Tsar Alexander II was so impressed by this work that he commissioned an identical one from the artist, which illustrated how quickly Koekkoek gained an international reputation. King Willem III commissioned a series of landscapes by Koekkoek which further enhanced the artist's reputation. "

36253,Paulus Potter,1625,1654,"Dutch painter and etcher, part of a family of painters, draughtsmen and etchers, son of Pieter Symonsz. Potter. He is celebrated chiefly for his paintings of animals. Animals appear prominently in all of Potter's works, sometimes singly but usually in small groups silhouetted against the sky, or in greater numbers with peasant figures and rustic buildings in an extensive landscape. Potter is one of the minor Dutch masters. Potter entered the Guild of St. Luke at Delft in 1646. In 1649 he moved to The Hague, where in the following year he married Adriana, daughter of the architect Claes van Balkeneynde. In 1652 Potter settled in Amsterdam. He probably received his early training from his father, the painter Pieter Potter, but his style shows little dependence upon that of earlier masters. In so short a career there was little development in style between the earlier and the later works, but 1647 seems to mark a peak in his achievement, for many of the finest paintings bear this date. Among works that depart from his normal scale or style, the huge Young Bull (1647; Mauritshuis, The Hague), which is life-size, is his most celebrated, though not necessarily his finest work, while Orpheus Charming the Beasts (1650; Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam) is an excursion into a poetic world. Potter's etchings of animals show all the skill and sympathy of his paintings. "

After his death in 1588, his workshop was run by his brother Benedetto Caliari and his sons Carlo Caliari and Gabriele Caliari (1568-1631), using the signature Haeredes Pauli. Only one signed work by Gabriele is known: an altarpiece of the Virgin and St Anne (Liettoli, parish church); its physical types are related to Veronese's but are rather awkward and heavy. In 1556, at age 18, Benedetto was recorded as the assistant of his elder brother, Paolo Veronese, decorating the ceiling of the church of San Sebastiano, Venice, and it is thought that he was Veronese's principal collaborator at the Villa Barbaro at Maser (c. 1561), producing much of the illusionistic architecture there and some of the landscapes (in situ). Frescoes (c. 1564-77) in the Vescovado, Treviso (in situ), offer the first known instance of his independent work; the Sala there is an echo of the Sala Crociera at Maser, with landscape views seen through a painted arcade. Benedetto Caliari is attributed with the decoration of the Villa Corner-Piacentini, Sant'Andrea (in situ), with some of the frescoes (after 1575) of the Villa Giusti at Magnadola (in situ) and with easel paintings (late 1560s) of St Peter Visiting St Agatha in Prison (Murano, San Pietro) and the Flight into Egypt (Caen, Musée des Beaux-Arts). He assisted Veronese with two commissions at the Doge's Palace, Venice (1574-82), and in 1575 he was in Padua, helping Veronese with the Martyrdom of St Justine (Padua, S Giustina), a work that clearly shows his hand. The Birth of the Virgin (1577; Venice, Accademia), commissioned for the Scuola dei Mercanti, is one of the few paintings documented as designed and executed by Benedetto Caliari, the forms are heavy, strongly modelled versions of Veronese's types, and the hand is somewhat mechanical.

He was an outstanding draughtsman and etcher of landscapes and topographical views and as an etcher also excelled in still-life subjects, best exemplified by his prints of shells and of muffs dating from the 1640s. Both fields show his instinct for direct and accurate recording. However, much of his illustrative work, enormously varied in subject-matter, is of no better than workmanlike quality and has always tended to undermine his reputation. Although Hollar spent some 32 of his 52 years of working life in England and signed himself with the anglicized form Wenceslaus, he always considered himself Bohemian, appending to his signature throughout his career the name of his native country or city.

His earliest surviving commission is the decoration of the chapel of St Philip Neri in Santa Margarita, Bevagna, with canvases showing scenes from the life of the saint (1627; in situ). In 1628 he worked with Andrea Sacchi, under Pietro da Cortona, on the decoration of the Villa Sacchetti at Castelfusano. He received his first commission from the Barberini family, for chiaroscuro room decorations in the Palazzo Barberini, in 1631, by which time he had already been commissioned to paint a large overdoor fresco in St Peter's; the composition of the lost Baptism of SS Processus and Martinianus (1630-35; destroyed before 1700) is recorded in a modello (private collection). After completing two frescoed ceilings in the Palazzo Barberini - Apollo and the Muses on Mt Parnassus (1631; destroyed) and God the Father Dividing the Angel Hierarchies (1632) - Camassei seemed on the verge of a major career when he was commissioned to paint the ceiling of the Gran Salone. However, Camassei declined the commission because he realized that it was beyond his talents. Instead it was awarded to Pietro da Cortona. A drawing at Chatsworth shows Camassei's preliminary scheme for part of the ceiling. "

1464,Mario Balassi,1604,1667,"Italian painter. After the initial apprenticeship with Jacopo Ligozzi, the young Florentine painter was taught by Matteo Rosselli and Domenico Passignano. The latter brought him to Rome, where Balassi worked under the protection of the Barberini and Pope Urban VIII. The powerful family commissioned him the Raphaellesque Transfiguration in Santa Maria della Concezione, dated 1630, and the Noli me tangere for San Cajo, influenced by Parmigianino (now Ente Cassa di Risparmio, Florence). The artist was back in his home-town around 1634, where he worked for important families, such as the Corsi and the Medici. In 1648 he left in the neighbouring Prato the altarpiece St Nicholas of Tolentino Resuscitates the Birds (Prato, Museo Civico), one of his major works, showing his interest in Salvator Rosa, Poussin and echoes of his master Passignano. In 1652 a sojourn of Balassi in Vienna is documented, attending the famous General of the Empire Ottavio Piccolomini. In his late works, Balassi, reminding us of the passion for Albrecht Dürer and of the activity as copyist affirmed by his biographer Filippo Baldinucci, tends to a meticulous and precise manner, stimulated by the painters of the early Renaissance. Such paintings have affinities with the refined style of his contemporary colleague Carlo Dolci, and of his older master, Jacopo Ligozzi, to whom Balassi's fascinating Queen of Armenia of the Galleria degli Uffizi, inspired by an older painting on panel by Alessandro Allori, has been previously attributed.

33769,Adriaen Brouwer,1595,1638,"Flemish genre painter who influenced artists in both Flanders and Holland. Brouwer went to study under Frans Hals in Haarlem about 1621, gained a high reputation in Holland, and returned to the South Netherlands in 1631. There he was arrested and imprisoned by the Spaniards as a spy until September 1633. He then settled in Antwerp. Except for a handful of landscapes, apparently from his last years, all of Brouwer's pictures are of subjects drawn from common life - showing peasants smoking, drinking, or brawling in taverns; quack surgeons operating on grimacing patients; and so on. Most of the pictures are small and painted on panel. The coarseness of his subjects contrasts with the delicacy of his style, which in its mature stage shows an unusual mastery of tonal values. Brouwer's best works are comparable with those of Jan Steen and David Teniers II (both of whom were influenced by him) and have a delicacy of colour combined with a breadth of handling that compensate for his subjects, in which his most fervent admirers see an almost Rembrandtesque pathos. The best collection of his works is in Munich. "

34043,Francis Cotes,1726,1770,"English painter and pastellist. He was the son of an apothecary and the elder brother of Samuel Cotes (1734-1818), a painter in miniature. Around 1741 he was apprenticed to George Knapton, who taught him to paint in oil and to draw in crayon, at which he became very accomplished. Rosalba Carriera had popularised crayon portraiture among Grand Tourists in Venice, and her example no doubt helped Cotes in his early work. Nevertheless, he did not imitate her soft modelling and delicate colour in such portraits as Elizabeth, Lady Carysfoot (1751; University of Michigan, Museum of Art, Ann Arbor), in which he used bold tones, strong lines and an almost universal portrait format, established in the 1740s and 1750s. He was fortunate in making crayon portraits of Maria Gunning and Elizabeth Gunning (1751; versions in National Gallery of Scotland, Edinburgh, National Portrait Gallery, London; and elsewhere), as his work reached a wide public through engravings made after them. Between 1753 and 1756 the Swiss pastelist Jean Etienne Liotard was in England, and his realistic approach to portraiture persuaded Cotes to abandon the Rococo portrait type. In Taylor White (1758; London, Foundling Hospital) he adopted a very naturalistic pose. His first oil paintings dates from as late as 1753, and he did not seriously take up the medium until four years later. By the 1760s, he had achieved wide-reaching success as the pre-eminent pastel painter in England. Cotes helped found the Society of Artists and became its director in 1765. Three years later he became a founding member of the Royal Academy. In his last decade, Cotes began to paint more in oil, a medium less labour intensive and more profitable than pastel. However, he remained renowned as a pastelist: John Russell wrote his famous 1772 treatise, The Elements of Painting with Crayon, as an explanation of Cotes's pastel technique, and Cotes was referred to as ""the Rosalba Carriera of England."" His inventive compositions, dramatic use of saturated colour, bold handling of line, and informal naturalism contributed to Cotes's fame. Tragically, his premature death at age forty-four cut short his career. "

35828,Moretto da Brescia,,,"Moretto da Brescia (originally Alessandro Bonvicino), Italian painter, active mainly in his native Brescia and the neighbourhood. He was a pupil of Titian and certainly his influence is apparent in Moretto's work. He was the leading Brescian painter of his day and had a large practice as a painter of altarpieces and other religious works, the best of which display an impressive gravity and a poetic feeling for nature (St Giustina with a Donor). However, his portraits, although much less numerous, are considered to be generally of higher quality and of greater importance historically. It seems likely that he introduced the independent full-length portrait to Italy, for although Vasari credits Titian with this distinction. Moretto's Portrait of a Gentleman of 1526 in the National Gallery, London, antedates any known example by Titian by several years. He passed on the thoughtful qualities to his pupil Moroni. "

36707,Alfred Sisley,1839,1899,"French/British impressionist landscape painter, born in Paris to English parents. He studied under Corot, Gleyre, and Courbet and was (1873) a founding member of the Impressionist group. After 1871, Sisley lived modestly at Moret-sur-Loing and painted subtly shimmering small-town landscapes that reveal a wistful, lyrical sensibility. Influenced by his friends Renoir and Monet in his selection of colours, Sisley was less daring than Monet in his use of the ""rainbow palette"" and closer to the Barbizon School tradition. His works, mostly landscapes, are distinguished from those of his colleagues by their softly harmonious values. His family was ruined by the Franco-Prussian War, and his life was a constant struggle against poverty. Not until after his death did his talent begin to be widely recognized. British by his birth and his nationality, though he lived in France, he is also in the tradition of Constable, Bonington and Turner. If he was subject to the influence of Monet, he moves away from his friend by his will of construction which makes him respect the structure of forms. "

Often he chose subjects from English history, as with two of his most famous works, The Little Princes in the Tower (Louvre, Paris, 1831) and The Execution of Lady Jane Grey (National Gallery, London, 1833). They are Romantic in flavour, but academically impeccable in their draughtsmanship and detailing. After a period when such pictures were totally out of favour, his work is once again being treated seriously. "

41817,Thomas Jones Barker,1815,1882,"English painter, part of a family of artists, son of Thomas Barker. He received his first training from his father and entered the Parisian studio of Horace Vernet in 1834. In Paris he produced a large number of history paintings, the most famous being the Bride of Death (1838-39; Bath, Victoria Art Gallery), which was painted for Princess Marie, daughter of Louis-Philippe, King of France, and won Barker the Légion d'honneur. After his return to England in 1845, Barker contributed regularly to the Royal Academy and the British Institution, exhibiting historical, literary and hunting scenes. His paintings, like those of Vernet, almost invariably included depictions of horses in action. From 1853 he began work on the large-scale military paintings for which he was best known (e.g. the Relief of Lucknow, 1859; London, National Portrait Gallery). The Duke of Wellington at Sauroren (Stratfield Saye House, Hants), first exhibited at the National Portrait Gallery in 1868, was probably commissioned by the Duke of Wellington. Barker was not favoured by the art critics of his day, nor was he rewarded with membership of the Royal Academy. His later work was painted with the print market in mind, and he enjoyed considerable commercial success. His principal patrons were print dealers such as the Manchester company Agnew & Sons. "

Sorolla studied at the Trades and Handicrafts School in Valencia and later at the San Carlos Fine Arts Academy of that city. During his student days, he met the photographer Antonio García, who later became his supporter. In 1888, he married García's daughter, Clotilde, who bore him three children between 1889 and 1895. In 1884 he received a scholarship from the Valencian authorities to study in Italy, where he lived from 1885 to 1889. In 1890, Sorolla settled in Madrid. Over the course of the following decade he worked hard to establish a name for himself, participating in numerous national and international exhibitions. In 1900, he won a medal of honour at the Paris World Fair. From 1905 the artist began to plan a series of major individual exhibitions, supported by leading dealers and galleries. The first took place in 1906 in Paris at the Galerie Georges Petit, and Sorolla became famous in Paris and as a consequence throughout Europe. Between 1909 and 1911, he was in the United States, where he showed his works in several cities. These presentations were supported by the Hispanic enthusiast and collector, Archer M. Huntington, who became Sorolla's main champion in America, commissioning him to decorate the Hispanic Society's library in New York with scenes of the different regions of Spain. In order to carry out the commission as accurately as possible, Sorolla travelled tirelessly through Spain, an undertaking that badly undermined his health and he suffered a stroke in 1920, which left him incapable of working. He died three years later. "

4298,Michelangelo Cerquozzi,1602,1660,"Italian painter, known as 'Michelangelo of the Battle' because of his predilection for battle scenes. He spent all his career in Rome, but had considerable contact with Northern painters; his friendship with the Dutchman Pieter van Laer led to his becoming the leading Italian exponent of bambocciate (small pictures low-life and peasant scenes). He also painted small religious and mythological works and still-lifes. He was born of Roman parents, baptized in the parish of S Lorenzo in Lucina. A member of the Accademia di S Luca since 1634, Cerquozzi attended meetings of the society as late as 1652. His friends included Domenico Viola, Pietro da Cortona and Giacinto Brandi. More significant were his associations with foreign residents in Rome. According to Baldinucci, Cerquozzi had special affection for the Spanish, owing to the patronage he received from the major-domo of the Spanish Embassy as a youth, and would often don Spanish attire as a sign of his sentiment. His Spanish connections may partly account for the many commissions he later received from patrons identified with Rome's pro-Spanish political faction. Cerquozzi enjoyed equally good rapport with northern European residents of Rome. He is documented as having quartered with artists from beyond the Alps, including Paulus Bor and Cornelis Bloemaert, for the bulk of his career. His contacts with Dutch and Flemish painters living in his native city profoundly affected his artistic development. "

He entered into a partnership with Lorenzo Costa after the latter came to Bologna c.1483 and was later influenced also by Perugino.. His most characteristic works are sweet, softly rounded Madonnas, which his large workshop produced in some numbers. He was also an accomplished portraitist. There are several examples of his work in the National Gallery, London. Before their fall, the Bentivoglio, rulers of Bologna, helped to fund frescoes for the oratory of St Cecilia, next to their parish church, San Giacomo Maggiore. The most prominent local artists of the period were involved, notably Francesco Francia, Lorenzo Costa and Tiziano Aspetti, and each appears to have contributed two frescoes. "

He was born in Venice and always signed himself as a Venetian, but he spent most of his career working in the Marches, particularly at Ascoli Piceno, and he also lived for some time at Zara in Dalmatia (now Croatia). His paintings are all of religious subjects, done in a n elaborate, old-fashioned style that owes much to the wiry Paduan tradition of Squarcione and Mantegna and yet is highly distinctive. Their dense ornamentation is often increased by the use of gesso decoration combined with the paint. The finest collection of his works is in the National Gallery in London and includes the delightful and much reproduced Annunciation (1486). Vittore Crivelli (died 1501-02), Carlo's brother, was a faithful but pedestrian follower. "

He was a notable if controversial figure associated with the development of the Neo-classical style of architecture and interior design and its dissemination throughout Europe and the United States. He trained as an architect in Paris under Germain Boffrand (1667-1754). He was awarded the Prix de Rome in 1746 and was ""pensionnaire du Roi"" at the French Academy in Rome from 1749 to 1754. In 1755 Clérisseau began an association with Robert Adam, the Scottish architect and designer, first as a teacher and later as an employee assisting him with his study of ancient architecture and decorative forms and their adaptation to new architectural style. In 1778 Clérisseau was appointed ""premier architecte"" and ""membre honoraire de l'Académie Impériale des Arts"" by Catherine the Great of Russia, and in 1781 ""premier architecte de Sa Majesté."" Clérisseau exhibited at the Royal Academy, England, in 1772. Clerisseau's one complete building is the gigantic Palais de Gouverneur (1776-89) in Metz. The State Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg has the largest collection of his drawings. "

In 1840 Pierre-Jean David d'Angers sponsored him for the École des Beaux-Arts. He stayed only briefly, moving to the Petite École to study decorative arts instead. Between 1850 and 1855, Carrier-Belleuse worked in England, designing ceramics and metalwork models for companies like Wedgwood. From 1857 he exhibited large-scale sculptures at the Salon, where he garnered medals and commissions from important patrons. Emperor Napoléon III employed him in public projects during the massive rebuilding of Paris from 1851 to 1870. Carrier-Belleuse made many terracotta pieces, but possibly the most famous is The Abduction of Hippodameia depicting the Greek mythological scene of a centaur kidnapping Hippodameia on her wedding day. He painted many portraits and landscapes on the Côte d'Opale, northern sea-borders facing England, chiefly in the village of Audresselles. Carrier-Belleuse had a sharp sense of how to combine historical elements with new technologies and the process of mass production. In his workshop, students like Auguste Rodin, who worked as an assistant in between 1864 and 1870, learned the value of series, editions, and variations made alongside unique, monumental Salon submissions.

Among the painters of the workshop he was the most adept at imitating the master's style, and later he became the director of the workshop. In his early period he produced genre paintings, half-length devotional images, decorative cycles, and large religious paintings, however, in his maturity he concentrated on religious paintings. His style derived primarily from his teacher's late manner, although he was receptive to other contemporary developments, particularly the refined elegance and lighter palettes of Giovanni Battista Tiepolo and Jacopo Amigoni. In addition to large altarpieces, Angeli also executed decorative commissions in palaces and villas. He is known for two canvases in the church of San Stae and for a series of frescoes at the Villa Widmann-Foscari near Padua. He was repeatedly employed by the Scuola di San Rocco, where he executed a number of ceiling paintings and restored works by Jacopo Tintoretto. Elected drawing master in 1756, Angeli was long a leading member of the Venetian Academy until the later 1770s. "

60777,Noël Hallé,1711,1781,"French painter, part of a family of artists. Daniel Hallé and his son Claude-Guy Hallé were active in Paris in the 17th century and the early 18th, chiefly as painters of religious scenes, and enjoyed high contemporary reputations. Claude-Guy's son Noël Hallé was one of the major French painters of the 18th century and received many commissions from the Crown, from the Church and from the city of Paris. His sister Marie-Anne Hallé (b. 1704) married the painter Jean Restout II, a nephew of Jean Jouvenet, in 1729. The family was thus part of a network of related artists who dominated the areas of history and religious painting in the early and middle decades of the 18th century.

Noël Hallé was a painter, draughtsman and printmaker. After studying architecture he became the pupil of his father and of his brother-in-law Jean Restout II. In 1736 he won the Prix de Rome, and he spent the period from 1737 to 1744 at the Académie de France in Rome. There he made a copy (untraced) of Raphael's Heliodorus Driven from the Temple (Rome, Vatican, Stanza d'Eliodoro), which he intended for a tapestry cartoon for the Gobelins, as well as executing drawings and engravings after antique monuments and works of art.

On his return to Paris, he was approved by the Académie Royale in 1746 and received (reçu) as a full member in 1748 on presentation of the Dispute of Minerva and Neptune over Choosing a Name for the City of Athens (Paris, Louvre). He became a professor at the Académie in 1755 and was named Surinspecteur de la Manufacture des Tapisseries de la Couronne at the Gobelins in 1770. In 1775 he was entrusted with the reorganization of the Académie de France in Rome, neglected by its aging director Charles-Joseph Natoire; he was rewarded for his efforts by ennoblement and the Order of St Michel. He was treasurer of the Académie Royale from 1776 to 1781 and became rector in the year of his death. "

40512,Aelbert Cuyp,1620,1691,"Cuyp is the name of a family of Dutch painters of Dordrecht, of which three members gained distinction. Jacob Gerritsz. Cuyp was the son of a glass painter and a pupil of Abraham Bloemaert at Utrecht. He is thought of today mainly as a portrait painter - his portraits of children are particularly fine - but in old biographies is lauded principally for his views of the countryside around Dordrecht. Benjamin Gerritsz. Cuyp (1612-52) was the half-brother of Jacob. He is noted principally for paintings of biblical and genre scenes which use Rembrandtesque light and shadow effects. Aelbert Cuyp is the most famous member of the family and now one of the most celebrated of all landscape painters, although he also painted many other subjects. He was the son and probably the pupil of Jacob Gerritsz. Cuyp. His early works also show the influence of Jan van Goyen. Aelbert was born and died at Dordrecht, but he seems to have travelled along Holland's great rivers to the eastern part of the Netherlands, and he also painted views of Westphalia. A prodigious number of pictures are ascribed to him, but his oeuvre poses many problems. He often signed his paintings but rarely dated them, and a satisfactory chronology has never been established. Although he had little influence outside Dordrecht, Cuyp had several imitators there, and some of the paintings formerly attributed to him are now given to Abraham Calraet (1642-1722), who signed himself 'AC' (the same initials as Cuyp). In 1658 Cuyp married a rich widow, and in the 1660s he seems to have virtually abandoned painting. He was almost forgotten for two generations after his death. Late 18th-century English collectors are credited with rediscovering his merits, and he is still much better represented in English collections, public and private, than in Dutch museums. His finest works - typically river scenes and landscapes with placid, dignified-looking cows - show great serenity and masterly handling of glowing light (usually Cuyp favored the effects of the early morning or evening sun). He approaches Claude more closely in spirit than any of his countrymen who travelled to Italy. "

Typically his paintings show handsome vessels on calm rivers or seas; they have a grandeur of composition, a limpid quality of light, and an exquisite sense of tonality that places them among the finest marine paintings of any time or place. Cappelle also painted winter landscapes and beach scenes. His work is rare; the best collection is in the National Gallery in London. He was affluent enough to make a distinguished art collection. "

As the pupil of Andrea Sacchi he continued the tradition of the classical Grand Manner, based on Raphael, and he gained an international reputation particularly for his paintings of the Madonna and Child, which are reworkings of types established during the High Renaissance. The rhetorical splendour of his work is thoroughly in the Baroque idiom, however, and the numerous altarpieces he painted for Roman churches (many still in situ) give whole-hearted expression to the dogmas of the Counter-Reformation. Maratta was also an accomplished fresco painter, and the finest portraitist of the day in Rome. He had a large studio and his posthumous reputation suffered when the inferior works of his many pupils and imitators were confused with his own paintings. "

33657,William Blake,1757,1827,"English artist, draughtsman, engraver, philosopher, and poet, one of the most remarkable figures of the Romantic period. From childhood he possessed visionary powers, and the engraving of Joseph of Arimathea, done at the age of 16, shows him already using a personal symbolism to express his mystical philosophy. His apprenticeship (1772-79) to the engraver James Basire (1730-1802), for whom he made drawings of the monuments in Westminster Abbey and other London churches, led him to a dose study of Gothic art and intensified his love of linear design and formal pattern. In 1779 he entered the Royal Academy Schools, but his relations with Reynolds were painful; later he was to find more sympathetic spirits in Stothard, Flaxman, Fuseli, and Barry. During the 1780s Blake worked as a commercial engraver, but from about 1787 he became engrossed in a new method of printing his own illustrated poems in colour, which he claimed to have been revealed to him in a vision by his brother Robert, then recently deceased. The first of these major works of 'illuminated printing', in which handwritten text and illustration were engraved together to form a decorative unit, was Songs of Innocence (1789). In 1793 with his wife, Catherine Boutcher, he settled in Lambeth. where he engraved his principal prose work, The Marriage of Heaven and Hell. He had little material success and in 1800, at the suggestion of William Hayley, poet and man of letters, he left London to settle for three years at Felpham on the Sussex coast. Here he continued a series of watercolours illustrating biblical subjects for his first and most generous patron, Thomas Butts, and also began to engrave Jerusalem, the last and longest of his surviving mystical writings. On his return to London, Blake made a series of drawings for Robert Blair's poem The Grave, and in 1809 held a small one-man exhibition for which he issued A Descriptive Catalogue, eloquently summarizing his aims and convictions about art. In 1818 he met John Linnell, whose sympathetic patronage ensured him a livelihood for the remainder of his life. For Linnell he carried out his engravings for The Book of Job and his magnificent designs for The Divine Comedy, on which he was working up to the time of his death. Linnell introduced to him a group of younger artists, including Varley, Calvert, and Samuel Palmer, who were inspired and stimulated by Blake's imaginative power. He thus passed his last years surrounded by a group of admiring disciples, who formed themselves into a kind of brotherhood called the Ancients. In art as in life Blake was an individualist who made a principle of nonconformity. He had a prejudice against painting in oils on canvas and experimented with a variety of techniques in colour printing, illustration, and tempera. His work as an artist is almost impossible to divorce from the complex philosophy expressed also through his poetry. He believed that the visible world of the senses is an unreal envelope behind which the spiritual reality is concealed and set himself the impossible task of creating a visual symbolism for the expression of his spiritual visions. He refused the easy path of vagueness and misty suggestion, remaining content with nothing less than the maximum of clarity and precision. To most of his contemporaries Blake seemed merely an eccentric, and his genius was not generally recognized until the second half of the 19th century. (Rossetti - another painter-poet with mystical leanings - was an early champion.) His output was enormous; there are important collections in the British Museum, the Tate Gallery, the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge, and several American museums. "

26140,Pellegrino Tibaldi,1527,1596,"Italian Mannerist painter, part of a family of artists. His early paintings show the influence of Bagnacavallo and of other Bolognese followers of Raphael, but his actual teacher is unknown. Vasari's claim that his own works in S Michele in Bosco, Bologna, formed Tibaldi's artistic education is hardly borne out by the latter's first efforts. The Mystic Marriage of St Catherine (c. 1545; Bologna, Pinacoteca Nazionale) is, in its classical, hierarchical simplicity, clearly inspired by Raphael's manner as interpreted by his Bolognese imitators; although it also bears delicate marks of Parmigianino's grace, the power of its expressive dignity and the architectural background hint at Tibaldi's future development. Tibaldi's Adoration of the Shepherds (c. 1546; Cento, Pinacoteca) shows an attempt at more elaborate composition, but its overtly Mannerist elements - perhaps derived from Vasari, as well as from Parmigianino - were not sufficiently digested to be fully integrated into the design. Summoned to Bologna around 1555 by Cardinal Giovanni Poggi, Tibaldi painted witty frescoes in the Palazzo Poggi, now the university, depicting the story of Ulysses. Extravagant posturings and combinations of forms created striking patterns that made space appear expansive and elastic. Pupils from the Carracci Academy studied his frescoes, and his ceilings directly inspired Annibale Carracci's decorations in the Palazzo Farnese gallery in Rome. After twenty years as architect for Cardinal Carlo Borromeo, Tibaldi traveled to Spain at the invitation of King Philip II in 1586. There he supervised the decoration of the Escorial and spread Mannerism to Spain through his vast output. Rich and ennobled, Tibaldi returned to Milan in 1596 and died shortly thereafter. "

He was employed as assistant on a decorative scheme in Lyon Cathedral before moving in 1851 to Paris, where he worked initially for the theatre decorator Charles-Antoine Cambon (1802-1875). He soon became a pupil of Horace Lecoq de Boisbaudran (1802-1897), whose methodical instruction and liberality in fostering individual talent proved of lasting benefit to Legros.

During this period Legros had a taste for early Netherlandish art and for French Romanticism, which was later superseded by his admiration for Claude, Poussin and Michelangelo. However, his devotion to Holbein proved constant and was apparent as early as his first Salon painting, Portrait of the Artist's Father (1857; Tours, Musée des Beaux-Arts). Legros's draftsmanship was similar to that of Ingres, but his approach was sentimental. He moved to England in 1863 and became a professor of fine arts at the Slade School of Art, London. Best known as a graphic artist, he depicted religious subjects, peasant scenes, and landscapes, which sometimes display a taste for the grotesque. His Angelus (1859) is in the Louvre. "

40545,Eugène Delacroix,1798,1863,"The greatest French painter of the Romantic movement. He was the son of a politician, Charles Delacroix, but there is some evidence to indicate that his real father was the diplomat Talleyrand, a friend of the family. His mother, Victoire Oeben, came of a family of notable craftsmen and designers. In 1816 Delacroix entered the studio of Pierre Guérin, who had earlier taught Géricault. His basic artistic education was obtained, however, by copying Old Masters at the Louvre, where he delighted in Rubens and the Venetian School. He met Bonington in the Louvre and was introduced by him to English watercolour painting. Constable's Hay Wain, exhibited in the 1824  Salon, also made a great impression on him and in 1825 he spent some months in England, admiring in particular Gainsborough, Lawrence, Etty, and Wilkie. In the Salon of 1822 he had his first public success with The Barque of Dante (Louvre, Paris). It was bought by the State (with Talleyrand perhaps pulling strings in the background), as was The Massacre at Chios (Louvre) two years later, ensuring the success of his career. Gros called this painting 'the massacre of painting', but Baudelaire wrote that it was a terrifying hymn in honour of doom and irremediable suffering. In 1832 Delacroix visited Morocco in the entourage of the Comte de Mornay and there acquired a fund of rich and exotic visual imagery which he exploited to the full in his later work (Sultan of Morocco, Musée, Toulouse, 1845). From the late 1830s his style and technique underwent a change. In place of luminous glazes and contrasted values he began to use a personal technique of vibrating adjacent tones and divisionist colour effects in a manner of which Watteau had been a master, making colour enter into the structure of the picture to an extent which had not previously been attempted. In spite of being hailed as the leader of the Romantic movement, his predilection for exotic and emotionally charged subject-matter, and his open enmity with Ingres, Delacroix always claimed allegiance to the classical tradition, and for his large works followed the traditional course of making numerous preparatory drawings. In his later career he became one of the most distinguished monumental mural painters in the history of French art. His public commissions included decorations in several major buildings in Paris: Palais Bourbon (Salon du roi, 1833-37; Library, 1838-47); the Library of the Luxembourg Palace (1841-46); and three paintings in the Chapelle des Anges of S. Sulpice (1853-61). In the last of these, his Jacob and the Angel and Heliodorus Expelled from the Temple are among the maturest expressions of his decorative richness of colour and grandiose structural integration. Baudelaire said of him that he was the only artist who 'in our faithless generation conceived religious pictures' and van Gogh wrote, 'only Rembrandt and Delacroix could paint the face of Christ.' Delacroix's output was enormous. After his death his executors found more than 9,000 paintings, pastels, and drawings in his studio and he prided himself on the speed at which he worked, declaring 'If you are not skilful enough to sketch a man falling out of a window during the time it takes him to get from the fifth storey to the ground, then you will never be able to produce monumental work.' Among great painters he was also one of the finest writers on art. He was a voluminous letter writer and kept a journal from 1822 to 1824 and again from 1847 until his death - a marvellously rich source of information and opinion on his life and times. His influence, particularly through his use of colour, was prodigious, inspiring Renoir, Seurat, and van Gogh among others. Delacroix's studio in Paris is now a museum devoted to his life and work, but the Louvre has the finest collection of his paintings. "

A decade later he left Antwerp, arriving in Amsterdam after travelling to Bergen-op-Zoom, Dordrecht and Delft. Van Mander's statement that he was buried in Amsterdam on 20 November 1593 is disputed by some sources because of a supposedly signed Adoration of the Shepherds dated 1595. Bol’s most important students included his stepson Frans Boels, Jacob Savery and Joris Hoefnagel."

His elegant art encouraged the movement away from Baroque drama towards a more tender, rocaille style in harmony with the earliest manifestations in Naples of the Arcadian school of poetry and of the Enlightenment. He painted frescoes, altarpieces and allegorical and mythological pictures. He trained with Francesco di Maria (1623-1690) in Naples, then with Luca Giordano. He came to the employ of the Spanish Viceroy of Naples. From 1702 to 1705, he worked in Paris, Calabria, and Genoa. Returning to Naples, he painted decorative schemes for Neapolitan churches, including the vault of the chapel of San Ignatius in the church of Gesù Nuovo in Naples. He also painted an Assumption of the Virgin for the Abbey at Monte Cassino. Between 1723 and 1725, Matteis lived in Rome, where he received a commission from Pope Innocent XIII. "

40553,Gaspare Diziani,1689,1767,"Italian painter and draughtsman. His earliest training was in Belluno with Antonio Lazzarini (1672-1732), the last exponent in the Veneto of Baroque tenebrism. Having moved to Venice, he joined the workshop of Gregorio Lazzarini and later that of Sebastiano Ricci, who was in Venice until 1715 and exerted the strongest influence on his development; presumably Diziani was familiar with Ricci's many paintings in Belluno before becoming his pupil. Between 1710 and 1720 he painted a group of eight pictures that included the Mary Magdalene for S Stefano, Belluno, and the Entry into Jerusalem for S Teodoro, Venice. His speed of production and technical assurance are demonstrated especially in his preparatory oil sketches, with colour applied in rapid and spirited penlike strokes. He was also working as a scenery painter in many Venetian theatres, an employment that led to commissions first in Munich (1717) and later in Dresden, where he was highly acclaimed. In 1719 he was active in Rome but by 1720 he was already back in Venice where he entered the ""Fraglia dei Pittori Veneziani"", remaining in the Veneto for the rest of his life. The works of Gaspare Diziani can be found in the Church of San Rocco in Belluno, dated 1727, several paintings in the Sacristy of the Church of Santo Stefano in Venice, dated 1733, the frescoes in Palazzo Spineda in Treviso, dated 1748, and the frescoes in the Church of San Bartolomeo in Bergamo. "
16333,Benjamin Marshall,1767,1835,"English painter. The son of Charles and Elizabeth Marshall, he spent his childhood at Seagrave, Leicestershire. During the 1780s he is believed to have taken drawing instruction from John Boultbee (1753-1812), although as late as 1791 his profession was recorded (on his brother-in-law's will) as schoolmaster. In this year he was introduced by William Pochin, MP, of Barkby Hall, Leicestershire, to the portrait painter Lemuel Francis Abbott with whom he subsequently embarked on an apprenticeship. This seems not to have lasted, for he completed a painting of a horse for George, Prince of Wales (later George IV), in 1792 (the first of several such commissions in the 1790s); this belies the traditional story that he turned to sporting art after seeing Sawrey Gilpin's Death of the Fox on exhibition at the Royal Academy in London in 1793. Marshall was at his artistic peak in the years 1798 to 1810, and the paintings produced from his brush during this period rank with the very greatest works of the English School of animal painting. While wary of the hanging committee at the Royal Academy, he exhibited thirteen pictures between 1800 and 1829 among which probably the best known was of the immensely fat Mr Daniel Lambert, shown in 1807. His Game Cock and The Trimmed Cock shown at the Academy in 1812 illustrate another of his interests as well as the familiar equestrian portraits. "

33587,Giovanni Bellini,1428,1516," Venetian painter, founder of the Venetian school of painting, Giovanni Bellini raised Venice to a center of Renaissance art that rivaled Florence and Rome. He brought to painting a new degree of realism, a new wealth of subject-matter, and a new sensuousness in form and color. Giovanni Bellini was born in Venice, Italy. Little is known about his family. His father, Jacopo, a painter, was a pupil of one of the leading 15th-century Gothic revival artists. Giovanni and his brother Gentile probably began their careers as assistants in their father's workshop. In his early pictures, Bellini worked with tempera, combining a severe and rigid style with a depth of religious feeling and gentle humanity. His first phase as an artist was strongly influenced by his formidable brother-in-law, the Paduan painter Andrea Mantegna, from whom he took a sculpturesque figure style; a sense for the potential eloquence of contour line; and occasional compositional ideas, as in the early Agony in the Garden (1460s, National Gallery, London), which was the first of a series of Venetian landscape scenes that continued to develop for the next century. Four triptychs in the Venice Accademia and two Pietàs, both in Milan, are all from this early period. Bellini's St. Vincent Ferrer altarpiece, which is still in the church of Santi Giovanni e Paolo in Venice, was painted in the mid-1470s. The personal components of Bellini's style, which became fundamental to the character of Venetian Renaissance painting as a whole, found expanded scope and an altered form in his painting of the 1470s. Flemish painting and, in 1475, Antonello da Messina's paintings, showed Bellini the possibilities of the oil medium, which he used from then on in place of tempera. His color took on added depth, and he explored the interactions of color, light, air, and substance still more fully. As a result, the distinction between solids and space became less clear; air began to mediate between them; contour lines gradually disappeared, to be replaced by transitions of light and shadow. Saint Francis (1480?, Frick Collection, New York City) represents an early stage in this process. The process is well advanced in two dated pictures of the 1480s: Madonna of the Trees (1487, Accademia, Venice) and  Madonna with Saints (1488, Church of the Frari, Venice). In 1479 Bellini took his brother's place in continuing the painting of great historical scenes in the Hall of the Great Council in Venice. During that year and the next he devoted his time and energy to this project, painting six or seven new canvases. These, his greatest works, were destroyed by fire in 1577. The Saint Francis also represents an important innovation of Bellini's in these years-paintings in which mood and meaning are conveyed at least as much by landscape as by figures. In the landscapes themselves, he combined a Flemish-inspired minuteness of brilliantly rendered detail with an Italian grasp of general principles as no previous artist had done. Equally significant in setting precedents was a series of monumental altarpieces portraying the Madonna enthroned among saints. In these, figures, space, light, architecture, and sometimes landscape were balanced with seemingly effortless perfection to achieve a complex but harmonious image of serene grandeur. Such paintings as, for example, Madonna with Doge Agostino Barbarigo (1488, Santa Pietro Martire, Murano), are pioneer exemplars of the High Renaissance style. The latest of the series, Madonna with Saints (1505, San Zaccaria, Venice), typifies Bellini's late style. Complex modulations of color establish a mellow overall tone within which the figures, their surroundings, light, and air seem inseparable-merely different aspects of a single identity. Forms are ample but less dense than before; paint is delicately applied to give their edges and surfaces a hazy indistinctness. The Feast of the Gods (1514, National Gallery, Washington, D.C.), the landscape of which was devised by Titian, shows Bellini, still flexible and inventive in his 80s, turning to classical and pagan subject matter shortly before his death in 1516 in Venice. At the end of his career Bellini became one of the greatest landscape painters. His ability to portray outdoor light was so skillful that the viewer can tell not only the season of the year but also almost the hour of the day. Bellini lived to see his own school of painting achieve dominance and acclaim. His influence carried over to his pupils, two of whom became better known than he was: Giorgione (1477?-1510) and Titian (1488?-1576). His younger contemporary, the German painter Albrecht Durer, wrote of Bellini in 1506: ""He is very old, and still he is the best painter of them all."" Bellini died in Venice in 1516. Bellini's historical importance is immense. In his 65-year evolution as an artist, he brought Venetian painting from provincial backwardness into the forefront of Renaissance and the mainstream of Western art. Moreover, his personal orientations predetermined the special nature of Venice's contribution to that mainstream. These include his luminous colorism, his deep response to the natural world, and his warm humanity. "

His importance as both a designer and propagandist for the arts cannot easily be overestimated, and his influence has continued to be felt throughout the 20th century. He was a committed Socialist whose aim was that, as in the Middle Ages, art should be for the people and by the people, a view expressed in several of his writings. After abandoning his training as an architect, he studied painting among members of the Pre-Raphaelites. Taking the Medieval craft guild as his model, he believed art derived from a craftsman's pleasure of work was instrumental to the rebirth of art. In 1861, he established ""The Firm,"" a company that designed furniture, wallpaper, and textiles, which included Rossetti, Ford Madox Brown, and Burne-Jones. His concerns that the artist should understand the craft process and to honour the materials chosen was later reflected in the ideas of the Bauhaus. He created a few paintings, but produced primarily stained glass, textiles, wallpapers, and book arts. In 1950 his home at Walthamstow became the William Morris Gallery. The William Morris Society was founded in 1956, and it publishes a biannual journal and quarterly newsletter. "

4076,Vittore Carpaccio,1455,1526,"Venetian painter. His life is poorly documented, and it is not known with whom he trained, but it is generally agreed that the chief influence on his work was Gentile Bellini. This is especially apparent in the first of the two great cycles of paintings that are his chief claim to fame - the Scenes from the Life of St Ursula, executed in the 1490s and now in the Accademia, Venice. Carpaccio's distinguishing characteristics — his taste for anecdote, and his eye for the crowded detail of the Venetian scene — found their happiest expression in these paintings. Especially original is the painting Dream of Saint Ursula. His other cycle, Scenes from the Lives of St George and St Jerome, painted for the Scuola (or 'Society') of S. Giorgio degli Schiavone, Venice, in 1502-07 (still in the Scuola), combines fantasy with detail minutely observed. The two best-known paintings of this cycle are Saint George Slaying the Dragon and Saint Augustin in His Study. After these two major commissions, however, Carpaccio's career declined, his work seeming old-fashioned, and he remained virtually forgotten until Ruskin revived his reputation in the 19th century. He is now rated as second only to Giovanni Bellini as the outstanding Venetian painter of his generation. "

41483,Bartolomeo Manfredi,1570,1630,"Italian painter, baptised in Ostiano, near Mantua and active mainly in Rome, where he was one of the most important of Caravaggio's followers. Giovanni Baglione writes that Manfredi was born in Mantua and stayed with Pomarancio while still a young boy. Manfredi's date of arrival in Rome is uncertain. Registered as living in the parish of Sant'Andrea della Fratte in 1610, he may have been in the city as early as 1603. According to Baglione, Manfredi was very good at painting in others' style. Indeed, he imitated the manner of Caravaggio in the extent that his pictures were mistaken for those of the more famous artist. He specialized in low-life scenes of taverns, soldiers in guardrooms, cardplaying, etc., and it was he rather than Caravaggio himself who was mainly responsible for popularizing this kind of work, particularly with painters from France and the Netherlands who came to Italy. In spite of his contemporary reputation, no works survive that are signed or documented as his, and several of the forty or so paintings now given to him were formerly attributed to Caravaggio, an example being the Concert in the Uffizi, Florence.

He settled in Bologna, and although his work is in an undistinguished Mannerist style, he played an important role as a teacher. He established an academy in 1572 and had more than 100 pupils, among whom were some of the most distinguished artists of the Bolognese School - Albani, Domenichino and Reni. The more celebrated academy of the Carracci was probably inspired by Calvaert's. "

Gerhard worked in the workshop of Giambologna in Florence until 1581 when he was called by Hans Fugger to southern Germany to execute the first Italian style fountain at the north of the Alps in the garden of his castle at Kirchheim. After a period of work in Augsburg, where he executed the Augustus fountain for the city (1594), Gerhard joined the court of the Dukes of Bavaria. Under the direction of Friedrich Sustris, like Gerhard a native of the Low Countries, he participated in the program of decoration for the Jesuit college church of St Michael in Munich."

36802,Alfred Stevens,1823,1906,"Belgian painter and lithographer. Born in Belgium, Stevens chose to spend his adult life in Paris where he was a comrade of the French Impressionists. Though never actually one of them, he embraced many of their artistic innovations, including the broken brushwork, dark swaths of background colour, and Japanese elements evident in this painting. He became famous for his society portraits of beautiful aristocratic women and fairly early in his career, became 'hors concours,' an honour which meant his automatic acceptance at every exhibition of the Paris Salon. By 1880 Alfred Stevens had reached the height of his career and the front rank of his profession. Stevens could trace his artistic descent from David (through his chief Belgian pupil, François-Joseph Navez) and Ingres himself, who is said to have given him criticism at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts. Moreover, his family on both sides took an active interest in the arts. Stevens's career began to blossom in the mid 1850's when he found his true subject matter, intimate scenes of women in contemporary dress, but his full success in this genre occurred in the following decade when his pictures were acquired by such purchasers as the Brussels Museum and King Leopold of the Belgians. At the great Paris Exposition Universelle of 1867 he triumphed with eighteen entries, a first-class medal, and promotion to officer of the Legion of Honour. Though he lived until 1906, his active career ended in the mid-1890's. So great, however, was his legacy that as the century closed, in 1900 he was accorded the first-ever retrospective exhibition of the work of a living painter at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts. "

61520,Francesco Mancini,1679,1758,"Italian painter. He was trained in Bologna in the school of Carlo Cignani, and his art is rooted in the classicist tradition of Bologna and Emilia Romagna. His achievements can be measured not only by his official appointments (French Academician, 1732; associate and regent of the Congregazione dei Virtuosi al Pantheon, 1743, 1745; principal of the Accademia di S Luca, 1750-51) but also by the numerous commissions, almost exclusively ecclesiastical, that he obtained both in Rome and in the provinces. These made a significant contribution to the development of the form and iconography of the altarpiece. Mancini holds a remarkable position in the circle of artists working in the Papal States during the first half of the eighteenth century. In 1714 he was summoned to work in Ravenna (in the library known as the Biblioteca di Classe), later in 1719 to the cathedral of Foligno, and in 1725 he moved to Rome. On his arrival in the papal city he was elected a member of the Academy of Saint Luke and executed several works including the Miracle of Saint Peter and Saint John in the Quirinal Palace and The Healing of Tabitha commissioned for St. Peter's Basilica by Pope Benedict XIII (1724-50). Knowledge of Mancini's profane works is rather more limited, and the best of these is the cycle of frescoes with the Stories of Psyche in the coffeehouse of the Palazzo Colonna (1735-40). The frescoes of the dome of the Chiesa Nuova dei Filippini in Perugia (1750), those of Our Lady of Mercy in Macerata (1756), and many other paintings bear evidence of his extensive activity in many churches in cities then belonging to the Papal States (Perugia, Citta di Castello, Fano, Forii, Rimini). He studied the great models of Emilian seventeenth-century painting but went back still further, fascinated by Correggio's mannerism. During the period he spent in Rome he was influenced by the works of Gaulli and Pietro da Cortona. The various experiences the artist absorbed resulted in painting that was far from academic, characterized rather by a compositional ease and agility of execution that create a vital synthesis of baroque and rococo motifs, enriched by recollections of the sixteenth century.

He emigrated to Philadelphia as a child; he first learned engraving and then studied painting at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts and at the National Academy of Design and Cooper Union. During the 1880s he spent a number of years traveling in Europe, living in London, Munich, and Paris. While traveling in Europe he painted his best-known work, After the Hunt (1885, California Palace of the Legion of Honor, San Francisco). In 1886 he settled in New York City. He executed mainly still-lifes and excelled in the rendering of textures and trompe-l'oeil (eye-deceiving) realistic effects. Other examples of his work are Emblems of Peace (Springfield Museum of Fine Arts), and The Faithful Colt (Wadsworth Atheneum, Hartford). His work, popular with the public, was generally dismissed by critics. After a long period of disrepute, his works again were appreciated and sought after when mid-20th-century critics recognized Harnett's outstanding skill at abstract composition. "

64722,Edward Welby Pugin,1834,1875,"English architect, son of A. W. N. Pugin. He studied with his father and was thrust into professional and family responsibilities by the latter's early death. Initially he followed his father's Decorated Gothic style and 14th-century English church plans, but at the church of St Vincent de Paul (1856-57), Liverpool, he adopted the Geometric Gothic style, with a well-lit interior and a shallow chancel. The church of Our Lady of Reconciliation (1859-60), Liverpool, continued these stylistic and planning developments with cheaper, simplified Early French detail in contrasting stone polychromy, with a widely spaced arcade and large apsed east end, not only countering the widespread Roman Catholic criticism of Gothic Revival planning but establishing a formula for church design that was as influential among Catholics as those of his father. Sts Peter and Paul in Cork, Ireland, is a church with lavish interior; one of his largest churches is the St Colman's Cathedral (1859-1919), Cobh, Ireland. He built also several convents and colleges. Pugin lived a life of frenetic employment and controversy not unlike his father's. He waged a pamphlet war with Alfred Barry, a son of Charles Barry, over their fathers' respective contributions to the design of the Palace of Westminster. He maintained offices at Ramsgate, London, Liverpool and Dublin, with numerous partnerships, the longest being with his brother-in-law George C(oppinger) Ashlin (1837-1921), one of his many pupils. His prolific practice involved him in bankruptcy in 1873 over the vast Granville Hotel (1869-70; partly destroyed), Ramsgate. Like his father, he designed both church and domestic furnishings, mostly executed by Hardman & Co. of Birmingham, the firm established by his father's collaborator John Hardman (1811-1867). A nervous drawing style and elaborate detail are characteristic of Pugin's mature style, which may be seen particularly in constructional polychromy and elaborate church roof structures. During his lifetime he was regarded as the leading Catholic church architect of the High Victorian period. After his death his large practice was continued in England and Scotland by his brother Peter Paul Pugin (1851-1904) and in Ireland from 1869 by Ashlin. "

From 1652 to 1654 he was court painter to Queen Christina of Sweden, of whom he did two portraits (Prado, Madrid, and National Museum, Stockholm), and after his return to France he worked mainly as a portraitist, developing a more personal style in which soft tonalities and skilful play with cascading draperies create a languorous, romantic effect (Self-portrait, Louvre, Paris).

40505,Antoine Coypel,1661,1722,"Coypel, family of French painter of which Noel was the head. He created a successful academic style on the example of Poussin and Le Brun. He was employed on the large decorative schemes of Louis XIV, notably at Versailles, and was director of the French Academy in Rome (1672-76) and then director of the Académie Royale in Paris (1695). Noel's son, Antoine went to Rome as a child with his father and there is a strong Italian element in his style. This comes out particularly in his most famous work, the ceiling of the Chapel at Versailles (1708) which derived from Baciccio's ceiling in the Gesù in Rome. This and Coypel's decorations at the Palais Royal in Paris (1702, destroyed) rank as the two most completely baroque schemes found in French art of this period. The Versailles ceiling is more successful than much of Coypel's work, which often combines the bombast of the Baroque and the pedantry of the classical style without the virtues of either. Antoine's half-brother, Noel-Nicolas painted with much more charm, mainly mythological subjects, but he seems to have had a rather timid personality and did not achieve the worldly success of the other members of the family. Indeed, he was the best painter of the family, but is the least famous. Chardin was briefly his assistant. Antoine's son Charles-Antoine was a much more forceful character than Noel-Nicolas and had a resoundingly successful career, largely due to his administrative capacity in the various official positions that he held. In 1747 he became director of the Académie Royale and chief painter to the king. He also was an accomplished writer of verse and plays as well as art criticism. As a painter he was versatile and prolific, but the weakest member of the family, his Supper at Emmaus (1746) in Saint-Merry, Paris, has been described as 'pathetically inept'."

In 1601 Kilian himself travelled to Italy. He went from town to town, mainly making reproductive engravings. In Venice (1602-03) he copied works by Titian, Paolo Veronese, Jacopo Tintoretto and Palma Vecchio; some of these prints are the only records of now untraced paintings. From this time he developed a painterly manner, achieving fine gradations of light and shade with richly varied use of the burin. "

41251,Giotto di Bondone,1266,1337,"Florentine painter and architect. He was already recognized by Dante as the leading artist of his day. His significance to the Renaissance can be gauged from the fact that not only the leaders in the early 15th-century transformation of the arts, such as Masaccio, but the key figures of the High Renaissance, such as Raphael and Michelangelo - one of whose early studies of Giotto's frescoes in the Peruzzi Chapel, Santa Croce, has survived - were still learning from him and partly founding their style on his example. The reasons for this are twofold. Firstly, his art is notable for its clear, grave, simple solutions to the basic problems of the representation of space and of the volume, structure, and solidity of 3-dimensional forms, and above all of the human figure. Secondly, he was a genius at getting to the heart of whatever episode from sacred history he was representing, at cutting it down to its essential, dramatic core, and at finding the compositional means to express its innermost spiritual meaning and its psychological effects in terms of simple areas of paint. His solutions to many of the problems of dramatic narrative were fundamental. They have subsequently been elaborated on in many ways, but they have never been surpassed. Part of the secret of Giotto's success in the representation of the fundamentals of human form and human spiritual and psychological reaction to events was his close attention to, and deep understanding of, the achievements of the sculptors Nicola Pisano, Arnolfo di Cambio and, above all, Giovanni Pisano, who were tackling the same basic representational problems in a naturally 3-dimensional medium. The essential unity of the arts in Giotto's day is even more dramatically illustrated by the fact that in the last years of his life he was assigned the major architectural commission in Florence, namely the building of the Campanile ('Giotto's Tower') of the cathedral (1344). The fact that it would almost certainly have fallen down if his successor, Andrea Pisano, had not immediately doubled the thickness of the walls is, in its way, no less informative of the nature of late medieval attitudes and of the triumphs and disasters that attended them. There can be no doubt whatsoever about Giotto's artistic stature and historical importance. Indeed, he so dominated the Florentine Trecento through his collaborators and followers, from Taddeo Gaddi onwards, that there was until relatively recently a thoroughly misleading tendency to lump together almost every artist in sight under the somewhat derogatory title of 'Giotteschi'. On the other hand, almost everything else about Giotto's career is problematic. His cut down mosaic of the  Navicella (c. 1300) in Rome, which was for his contemporaries by far his most important work, is now a ghostly echo of its former self. His signed altarpieces, the Stigmatization of St Francis (Paris, Louvre), the Baroncelli Altarpiece (Florence, Santa Croce) and the polyptych of the Madonna and Saints (Bologna, Pinacoteca Nazionale), seem to be very largely shop work protected by his signature. However, the Ognissanti Madonna (Florence, Uffizi) is universally accepted as his although it is neither signed nor documented. Other works with a good claim to be considered as his include the Dormition of the Virgin (Berlin) and a Crucifix in Santa Maria Novella, Florence. The frescoes in the Arena Chapel, Padua (c. 1304-13), depict scenes from the lives of St Joachim and St Anne and the Virgin, and from the Life and Passion of Christ. These frescoes, the masterpiece on which the whole modern concept of his style is based, are unsigned and undocumented, as are those in the Bardi and Peruzzi Chapels (Life of St Francis and Lives of Sts John Baptist and Evangelist) in Santa Croce, which are generally accepted as the only reasonable foundation for an idea of his stylistic evolution during his maturity. All this, however, is as nothing to the endless controversy which surrounds his date of birth and the attribution to him of the frescoes of the Life of St Francis, painted, probably in the mid-1290s, on the lower walls of the Upper Church of San Francesco at Assisi. For virtually all Italian scholars they constitute the early work of Giotto. For the majority of non-Italian specialists on the subject they do not, and a daunting proportion of the almost 2000 major items in the ever more rapidly accumulating Giotto bibliography is largely devoted to fanning the flames. Fortunately, perhaps, for the sanity of the earnest and discriminating inquirer only a handful of these outpourings can be said to clarify the issue in any substantial way. What should at least be obvious by now is that the frescoes at Assisi are, in detail and as an entire, coherent, carefully planned scheme, like the Arena Chapel frescoes, amongst the seminal achievements in the history of Italian late medieval painting. They stand at the dawning of a new age and their appeal as works of art is not one whit diminished if, as may well be the case, they are not in fact by Giotto. "

Born into a family of skilled engravers, he learnt the craft first from his father, Thomas Kensett (1786-1829), and then from his uncle Alfred Daggett (1799-1872). He studied in England, France, and Italy from 1840 to 1847, relying heavily on his engraving skills to financially support his new artistic endeavours in Europe. Upon his return to the United States, Kensett quickly became associated with the Hudson River School of painting. His landscape paintings became an immediate success, and his work served to inspire many artists who endeavoured to further develop the fledgling American landscape tradition. Kensett's accomplishments were publicly acknowledged when he was appointed a full member of the National Academy of Design in 1849, as well as when he became a founding trustee of The Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1870. While he was respectful of and influenced by the artistic tenets of the Hudson River painters, Kensett's mature work enhanced his predecessors' vision of the countryside. Turning to luminism, a later manifestation of the Hudson River ideal, Kensett chose to paint more than the unique grandeur of the American landscape by striving to capture the ethereal qualities of light and fleeting subtleties of atmosphere. Trained in Europe and influenced by the works of French painter Claude Lorrain and British artist John Constable, Kensett was also inspired by American contributions to the landscape genre found in the works of such artists as Thomas Cole.

He worked as a painter, draftsman and engraver. Leaving his hometown, Mechelen, he moved to Antwerp where he joined the workshop of Frans Floris. Their collaboration lasted until the master's death. He was enlisted as a master in the Guild of St. Luke of Antwerp in 1555-56. He became a citizen in 1559. He presumably spent some time in Italy in the 1550s. His activity as a draftsman and illustrator exceeded the efforts he devoted to painting. From 1556, but mainly after 1570, he was frequently employed by Christophe Plantin (1520-1589), the famous Antwerp book printer and publisher. The praises he received for his work as an illustrator from his contemporary Karel van Mander are justified by his numerous drawings as well as prints made after them. He was especially talented in rendering themes with great psychological authenticity. "

Cooper showed an early aptitude for drawing and at the age of 13 he went to work for his uncle, William Davis, who was then manager of Astley's Circus; a circus famous for its spectacular equestrian dramas, providing the boy with the opportunity to study horses at first hand. After Cooper set about painting a portrait of a horse which he had often ridden, William Davis secured for his nephew a place in the studio of the celebrated horse-painter Ben Marshall, where he received instruction and was introduced to prospective patrons. He also studied and copied illustrations in The Sporting Magazine and became a contributor himself in 1811 with the portrait of a pointer. Cooper was prolific: 189 of his paintings were engraved for The Sporting Magazine; he sent 332 paintings to the Royal Academy beginning in 1812, and another 87 to other London Exhibition venues. He was amongst the most popular painters of equine and canine portraiture, with an exalted clientele. He was popularly known as the ""English Horace Vernet"". The vigour of his drawing is rooted in the classical age to which he was born, but the high and lustrous ""finish"" on his paintings presages the work of Herring (who was his pupil), Landseer and the high Victorians.

33617,Émile Bernard,1868,1941,"French painter and writer, the son of a cloth merchant. Relations with his parents were never harmonious, and in 1884, against his father's wishes, he enrolled as a student at the Atelier Cormon in Paris. There he became a close friend of Louis Anquetin and Toulouse-Lautrec. In suburban views of Asnières, where his parents lived, Bernard experimented with Impressionist and then Pointillist colour theory, in direct opposition to his master's academic teaching; an argument with Fernand Cormon led to his expulsion from the studio in 1886. He made a walking tour of Normandy and Brittany that year, drawn to Gothic architecture and the simplicity of the carved Breton calvaries. In Concarneau he struck up a friendship with Claude-Emile Schuffenecker and met Gauguin briefly in Pont-Aven. During the winter Bernard met van Gogh and frequented the shop of the colour merchant Julien-François Tanguy, where he gained access to the little-known work of Cézanne. Most of his notable work was accomplished at a young age, in the years 1886 through 1897. He is also associated with Cloisonnism and Synthetism, two late nineteenth-century art movements. Less known is Bernard's literary work, comprising plays, poetry, and art criticism as well as art historical statements that contain first hand information on the crucial period of modern art to which Bernard had contributed.

He was a pupil of Largillière and painted some portraits, but he is renowned chiefly as one of the outstanding animal painters of the 18th century. With Desportes he was the foremost exponent of hunting scenes and still-life with dead game. Some of his best work was done as a tapestry designer, and he was head of the Beauvais and Gobelins factories from 1734 and 1736 respectively. He also did book illustrations, notably for an edition of La Fontaine's Fables (1755). His son Jacques-Charles, a flower and animal painter, sometimes collaborated with him. "

4098,Giulio Carpioni,1613,1678,"Italian painter and etcher. He was a pupil of Alessandro Varotari, through whom he was drawn to the early works of Titian, though he also responded to the Venetian Caravaggesque works of Carlo Saraceni and Jean Leclerc. Around 1631 he and Varotari made a brief visit to Bergamo, where he came into contact with Lombard art. On his return to Venice he became acquainted with Pietro della Vecchia; the etchings of Simone Cantarini and Odoardo Fialetti as well as Nicolas Poussin's bacchic scenes (through the etchings of Pietro Testa) were further influences. In 1638 he settled in Vicenza and executed most of his work there. His first dated works are two vast lunettes, the Apotheosis of Vincenzo Dolfin (1647) and the Apotheosis of Girolamo Bragadin (1648; both Vicenza, Museo Civico), which are close in style to similar works by Francesco Maffei. There followed the Martyrdom of St Catherine (1648; Vicenza, S Caterina), a Self-portrait (Milan, Brera) in which he depicted himself crowned with laurel drawing an antique procession, and the mythological frescoes (c. 1650) in a small room in the Villa Caldogno-Nordera at Caldogno, Vicenza. At this time the Baroque style of Maffei dominated art in Vicenza, and Carpioni only gradually moved away from his influence. His Adoration of the Magi (mid-1650s; Vicenza, Museo Civico), painted for the oratory of the Zitelle in Vicenza, reflects Maffei's mannered elegance and brilliant painterly freedom, while St Nicholas Exorcising the Demons (c. 1656; Vicenza, oratory of S Nicola) suggests a reaction against this decorative exuberance and a return to the naturalism of Caravaggio. After Maffei's departure to Padua in 1657 Carpioni entered the most productive phase of his career. Of his canvases in the oratory of S Chiara, Vicenza, only one is dated, the Five Saints of 1663; they are in an unusual vertical format and include the Baroque St Clare Repulsing the Saracens and the warmly realistic Miracle of the Mule. There followed a series of decorative friezes, which renew a Vicentine tradition, among them the unusually long frieze of putti, allegories and grisaille sibyls (c. 1665; Vicenza, Museo Civico) for the Palazzo Negri, Vicenza, and an allegorical frieze (c. 1665) in the Palazzo Giustiniani Baggio, Vicenza; for the latter he collaborated with the sculptor Giambattista Barberini (d 1666), the quadratura specialists Giuseppe Arighini and Giambattista Gattucci and the fresco painters Pietro Ricchi and Giovanni Ghisolfi. His most important late decorative work dates from 1671 and consists of 11 canvases showing the Triumph of St Nicholas and the Virtues, for the ceiling of the oratory of S Nicola, Vicenza. His most original works, however, are his small bacchanals, indebted to Titian and to Testa, which he interpreted with wit and a melancholy charm. His favourite subjects were the Triumph of Silenus (e.g. Venice, Accademia) and the Realm of Hypnos (e.g. c. 1656, Vienna, Kunsthistorisches Museum.; c. 1665, New Haven, CT, Yale University Art Gallery). Carpioni was also a gifted etcher, of religious and mythological subjects (e.g. The Elements, and there are collections of his drawings at the Uffizi, Florence, and the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford. "

There he met Theodore Géricault and learned the art of watercolour painting from the English Romantic, Richard Parkes Bonington. Much of Lami's early work was in lithography, which had only recently become a commercially viable medium. Between 1819 and 1821 he produced numerous lithographs depicting the Spanish cavalry, as well as a large series illustrating the uniforms of the French Army. Lami's paintings of military subjects caught the attention of royalty and he quickly established ties to the French court. Louis-Philippe commissioned him to make a number of military paintings for the château at Versailles, which the King turned into a museum in 1837. At this point, Lami began to concentrate on court life, painting scenes of the bourgeoisie. He then turned to watercolour, which would remain his favourite medium for the rest of his life. In his later years, he became increasingly interested in depicting historical events. At the age of seventy-nine, Lami helped establish the Society of French Watercolorists. He continued to work until his death at the age of ninety. "

Almost nothing is known of his life, and only half a dozen paintings (and an even smaller number of etchings) are recognized as being by him. According to Houbraken, he was a pupil of Rembrandt, possibly in or shortly before 1650. All the works that are dated are of the 1650s, and it would seem that at this time Drost was one of Rembrandt's closest and most talented followers. His earliest dated paintings are two pendants of 1653: the Portrait of a Man (New York, Metropolitan Museum) and the Portrait of a Woman (The Hague, Museum Bredius). An early etching signed w drost 1652 is probably a self-portrait, in which Drost portrayed himself as a young man drawing. His Portrait of a Young Man in the Wallace Collection, London, bears a false Rembrandt signature. "
17466,Agostino Mitelli,1609,1660,"Italian painter. He and his collaborator Angelo Michele Colonna are renowned as pre-eminent exponents of quadratura, the painting of illusionistic architectural perspectives. They learnt this art from Girolamo Curti (1575-1632), who had made a speciality of it in Bologna. The two artists created a range of ceiling enframements and decorative ensembles that were architecturally the most unified and rational of their time. This achievement, recognized as the 'Bolognese style', was widely applauded and imitated until the advent of Neo-classicism, when it was criticized for excesses and violations of architectural probity.

When the pre-eminent engraver Hendrick Goltzius married Matham's mother in 1579, he took Jacob on as an apprentice. Matham worked more closely with Goltzius than others of his circle, engraving many of the master's drawings and paintings and closely imitating his teacher's manner. Despite Matham's prolific output, his artistic personality does not emerge clearly, and the oeuvres of both engravers contain unsigned works. Jacob Matham made several engravings after the paintings of Peter Paul Rubens from 1611-1615, and also a series after the work of Pieter Aertsen. In 1613, engraver Jan van de Velde was apprenticed to him. He was the father of Jan, Theodor and Adriaen Matham. "

57151,Théo van Rysselberghe,1862,1926,"Belgian painter, designer and sculptor, brother of the architect Octave Van Rysselberghe (1855-1929). He was enrolled in the Academie van Beeldende Kunsten in Ghent at an early age. In 1879 he became a pupil of Jean-François Portaels, director of the Académie Royale des Beaux-Arts in Brussels, whose Orientalist works he admired. Van Rysselberghe first exhibited at the Salon in Brussels in 1881. The next year he won a travelling scholarship and, following in the footsteps of Portaels, visited Spain and Morocco. With fellow artists Darío de Regoyos and Constantin Meunier, Van Rysselberghe recorded picturesque scenes of everyday life. He exhibited these Mediterranean pictures in 1883 at L'Essor. He attended the historic meeting on 28 October 1883 at which the avant-garde exhibition society Les XX was created, and at their exhibition in 1885 he showed the results of a second Moroccan trip, including the exotic Fantasia (Brussels, Musée Royal d'Art Moderne). In 1886 the painter travelled with the poet Emile Verhaeren to Paris, where he met Georges Seurat whose painting he admired, particularly A Sunday Afternoon at the Island of Grande Jatte. Following his contact with Neo-Impressionists like Seurat, Signac, Cross and Pissarro in Paris, van Rysselberghe turned to Pointillism himself, becoming the main exponent of the style in Belgium and one of Belgium's most important artists of the fin-de-siecle period. In the late 1880s and early 1890s, the painter travelled in Spain, North Africa, the Middle East and Europe. In 1898, he moved from Brussels to Paris where he joined the literary Symbolist group. After the death of Georges Seurat, van Rysselberghe gradually abandoned the Pointillist technique and turned to a more Realist style. He was famous for his portraits of poets and other literary figures and created an oeuvre of etchings and lithographs. He also designed some beautiful various posters for bookshops and art galleries. Van Rysselberghe and his wife, who was fondly known as Madame Théo, are said to have played an important role in the life of André Gide. Between 1905-1910, he settled in Saint Clair in Provence, where he primarily executed portraits of his wife as well as of his daughter Elisabeth. "

After military service he resumed his studies at the Brera in 1882, but he was expelled the following year for protesting against the traditional teaching methods. During this period, in which he produced his first sculptures, he was in contact with the Milanese literary and artistic avant-garde group Gli Scapigliati, which fostered in him the desire to produce naturalistic art. Rather than traditional historical, literary or allegorical themes, Rosso therefore preferred contemporary subjects: ordinary people and the destitution of modern urban life, which he captured faithfully with photographic accuracy. From 1884 to 1886 he studied with Jules Dalou in Paris where he became familiar with the sculptures of Rodin and the paintings of the Impressionists. His were everyday themes, and he reproduced visual impressions in three dimensions. Rosso modeled primarily in wax and plaster, and continued the dissolution of form in the Impressionist sense. Sculptors of the early 20th century owe him a debt of gratitude for various impulses to creativity. "

He began his first formal art education in 1853 at the Beaux-Art Academy in Paris. Upon finishing his studies in 1865, Loir had his debut in the Salon of Paris with ""Paysage a Villiers-sur Seine"" for which he received the highest acclaim. Loir then enrolled into studies under Jean Amable Amedee Pastelot (1810-1870) to become a mural painter. He became a very popular ceiling and mural painter. One of Loir's first commissions was to paint the murals and ceilings at the Chateaux du Diable in 1866. Many of Loir's works, which include oils, watercolours, and lithographs, were acquired by the city of Paris and by French museums. In 1870, he was commissioned into the military to record the battles of Bouret. Loir concentrated exclusively on painting views of Paris. In these works, Loir caught and expressed the many faces of Paris, at all hours of the day. Though some thought him excessively methodical, he was undeniably endowed with exceptional powers of observation and craftsmanship. It was because of his work during this campaign of 1870, that Loir was elected to be the official painter of the Boulevards of Paris. This boosted his career and reputation. In 1879 in was awarded the Bronze metal from the Exposant Fidèle des Artistes Français. Loir was also elected into the Legion of Honour in 1898. "

His works are characterised by a strong contrast of light and dark, in spite of their overall cool greyishness. Toorenvliet was trained by his father Abraham, a glass painter and draughtsman working in Leiden. In 1670 he went to Rome where he joined the Schildersbent, the society of Dutch and Flemish painters living there. He is recorded as living in Venice in 1673, and, from 1676 until 1679, in Vienna, and there is also documentary evidence of his presence in Leiden and Amsterdam in 1680. As of 1686 Toorenvliet was a member of the Leiden Academy of Painting, and in 1703 he was mentioned as its Dean. He was one of the founders of the Leiden Academy of Drawing in 1694, and in 1712 he was appointed Professor of Drawing. In 1717 he was registered in the guild books as 'informator pingendi.' "

Applying Benjamin West's and John Singleton Copley's realistic innovations in history painting to American subjects, he created a series of images, reproduced in countless illustrations, that have become icons of American nationalism. They are also symbolic of his lifelong political and artistic identity. Trumbull fought in the American War of Independence (for a time he was aide-decamp to George Washington) and his career was devoted mainly to depicting the outstanding events and personalities of the revolution. He was strongly influenced by Benjamin West, with whom he studied in London. In 1817 he became President of the American Academy of Fine Arts in New York, but his tyrannical attitude, especially towards young painters, led to many members leaving to set up the National Academy of Design in 1825. His pictures did not sell well, so  in 1831 he assigned those in his studio to Yale University Art Gallery in exchange for an annuity. The most famous work there, and one of the most reproduced images in American art, is The Declaration of Independence (1786-97), in which most of the portraits were painted from life. His larger works are usually fairly stodgy, but his smaller pictures and sketches can be much livelier. Trumbull, who died an embittered old man, published an autobiography in 1841. "

He was a pupil of Albani, but his style is closer to that of Guido Reni and he became the main force in upholding the tradition of Bolognese classicism into the 18th century. He was the leading master in Bologna during the later decades of the 17th century, commanding a position of authority comparable to that of Carlo Maratti in Rome. He bore the title of Conte, and his biographer Giovan Pietro Zanotti wrote that he 'always worked for glory, not for need'. Zanotti’s emphasis on Cignani's 'new manner' refers to the reflective, intimate mood of his art, presaged in the later pictures of Guido Reni and Guercino, and in those of Simone Cantarini. This gentle manner, which prevailed in the second half of the 17th century, marks a break with the more energetic style of earlier Bolognese classicism. In 1711 he became the first president of the Accademia Clementina in Bologna. "

33986,Joos van Cleve,1480,1541,"Joos van Cleve (Joose van der Beke) Netherlandish painter, born presumably at Cleves in the lower Rhine region and active mainly in Antwerp, where he became a master painter in 1511. He is identified with the Master of the Death of the Virgin. He was dean of the painters' guild in 1515 and 1525 and seems to have been one of the most productive Antwerp painters of his time, but his career is ill-defined. There is a flavour of Leonardo in some of his works, and he may have visited Italy. The dispassionate realism of his portraits owes something to the influence of Quentin Massys, but wide stylistic differences are apparent in his work as a whole. Almost certainly he worked in France and there are several portraits of Francis I and his wife attributed to him, as is a portrait of Henry VIII of England (Royal Collection, Windsor). He collaborated with Joachim Patenier: a Rest on the Flight into Egypt (Musées Royaux, Brussels) is possibly a joint work. Joos's son, Cornelis van Cleve (1520-67), was also a painter. He was known as 'Sotte Cleve' (Mad Cleve) after becoming insane in 1554 - a result of failing to win the post of Court Painter to Philip II of Spain. "

30703,Rosalba Carriera,1673,1757,"Rosalba Carriera was a Venetian woman pastellist who had a great vogue in Venice, chiefly among British tourists, in Paris (1720-21), and Vienna (1730). She painted snuff boxes for the tourist trade with miniatures on ivory, a technique she seems to have pioneered as against the earlier use of card as a ground. She was painting miniatures by 1700, and her earliest pastels are of c. 1703. In 1705 she was made an 'accademico di merito' by the Accademia di San Luca in Rome, a title reserved for non-Roman artists. She achieved immense popularity, and made pastel portraits of notabilities from all over Europe, She also had great success with her near-pornographic demi-vierges, much earlier examples of the genre than those by Greuze. She went blind at the end of her life, which provoked a mental collapse. There are 157 of her pastels in Dresden, and others in the Royal Collection, London (Victoria and Albert Museum) and elsewhere. "

34310,Pieter Dubordieu,1609,1683,"Pieter Dubordieu (also Pieter du Bordieu), Dutch painter, active mainly in Leiden. He was born in l'Isle de Bouchard, France, and apparently received his training there. He was doubtless trained in the tradition of his day, a combination of minute Flemish realism with a feeling for decorative colour characteristic of the French court style in the sixteenth century. He enrolled in the University of Leiden in 1628, was recorded in that city in the early 1630s and married there in 1633. Three years later Dubordieu moved to Amsterdam where he became 'burger' (or citizen) in 1636. Only two years later he moved back to Leiden again, where he would remain for the rest of his life. Dubordieu was a member of the Leiden Guild of Saint Luke between the years 1648 and 1652 and again from 1657 until 1676. Dubordieu was specialized in portrait paintings. He was very much influenced by the Northern Dutch tradition. After the Reformation, a style arose in the North which was primarily sober, simple, and realistic. In portraiture this realism demonstrated itself in the avoidance of idealization and flattery. Within a few years Dubordieu had so completely adopted the Dutch style of portraiture practiced in The Hague and Delft, that his portraits were often mistaken for works by Michiel Jansz. van Miereveld or Paulus Moreelse.

36141,Giuseppe Passeri,1654,1714,"Italian painter and draughtsman, nephew of the painter Giovanni Battista Passeri (c. 1610-1679). He was trained by his uncle and then by Carlo Maratti. The early sources (Pio, Pascoli) claim that he became Maratti's favourite pupil and that, at his own expense, Maratti encouraged him to copy the Roman works of Giovanni Lanfranco, an assertion that is corroborated by surviving copies. Maratti taught him to respect the traditions of Michelangelo and Annibale Carracci, to study the mastery of composition, gesture and expression in works by Reni, Domenichino and Poussin, and to emulate the beauty of colour in the art of Titian and Correggio. Above all, Maratti recommended him to study Raphael, whom he himself revered. Many of Passeri's drawings after these and other artists have survived (three in Düsseldorf). It was through these studies that he developed a relatively independent painting style, one that is distinguished by increasingly free brushwork, a subtle use of colour and lively composition. "

40513,Pascal-Adolphe-Jean Dagnan-Bouveret,1852,1929,"French painter. He refused to leave France when his father Bernard Dagnan moved to Brazil in 1868, and he remained with his maternal grandfather in Melun (nr Paris). Later he added the maternal surname Bouveret to his own in gratitude for his grandfather's support, which enabled him to study in Paris. Pascal-Adolphe-Jean Dagnan-Bouveret's career began with his admission to the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in April 1869 where he initially worked in the studio of Alexandre Cabanel. Like all young Frenchmen at the time, his career was temporarily derailed by the Franco-Prussian War and the Paris Commune of 1870-71, but he resumed his education in 1872, settling comfortably into the studio of Jean-Léon Gérôme. In 1875, Dagnan-Bouveret debuted at the Salon with a depiction of the triumphant Atalanta, the Greek heroine who bested all her male competitors in a footrace. A contemporary of Jules Bastien-Lepage, Dagnan-Bouveret painted elegant genre and literary themes until 1880, when he exhibited a work entitled The Accident at the annual Salon. The work depicted a young peasant boy being tended to by the country doctor, and signaled the artist's shift in focus from elegant portraits and genre scenes to the life of peasants and the working class. His approach to these subjects followed the lead of Lepage in its acute perception of psychological expression and its sense of detached observation of the life of the poor. With Bastien-Lepage's death in 1884, Dagnan-Bouveret became the leading artist of the movement, developing his work to the limits of Naturalistic observation and psychological symbolism. Throughout the 1880s and 1890s, Dagnan-Bouveret developed a very successful career in a variety of genres; he continued to create naturalist images of daily life, both urban and rural, and increasingly focusing on religious painting. In 1886, he began a series of paintings on the theme of the Breton custom of the 'pardon', an annual pilgrimage associated with the feast day of the patron saint of a local church. The series of paintings on the Brittany pardons also opened the door for Dagnan-Bouveret's exploration of other religious subjects. In the late 1880s, he began creating paintings of the Madonna, using the Renaissance example of Raphael as inspiration, but transforming the image into a contemporary Symbolist meditation. At the Exposition Universelle of 1900, Dagnan-Bouveret's status as a respected artistic leader enabled him to showcase his paintings, including the huge The Lord's Last Supper, in a separate installation on the fair grounds. As with his Madonna paintings, Dagnan-Bouveret based the composition of The Lord's Last Supper on Renaissance models, but the mystical lighting spotlights very contemporary French faces on the apostles. In November of 1900, Dagnan-Bouveret was elected to the Académie des Beaux-Arts of the Institut de France, one of the youngest painters to ever receive this honour.  Although often overwhelmed by the swift developments of modernism in the opening decades of the twentieth century, he continued to paint religious images as well as portraits until his death in 1929.

42484,Antoine Caron,1521,1599,"French Mannerist painter. He is one of the few French painters of his time with a distinctive artistic personality, and his work reflects the refined but unstable atmosphere of the Valois court during the Wars of Religion (1560-98). He worked at Fontainebleau under Primaticcio in the 1540s and later became court painter to Catherine de Médicis, wife of Henry II of France. His few surviving works include historical and allegorical subjects in the manner of court ceremonies, scenes of magic and prediction, and massacres, as in Massacre under the Triumvirate (1566) in the Louvre, his only signed and dated painting. His style is characterized most obviously by extremely elongated, precious-looking figures set in open spaces that seem too large for them. He had a penchant for gaudy colours and bizarre architectural forms. Some of the works attributed to him may be by other hands, however, for French painting of his period is such an obscure area that Caron's name is liable to be attached to anything similar to his known oeuvre.

33894,Giovanni Benedetto Castiglione,1609,1664,"Genoese painter called 'Il Grecchetto', a pupil of van Dyck, in whose studio in Genoa he worked from 1621. He was - for an Italian - much influenced by foreigners, for his style was formed by Flemish painters and Rembrandt's etchings; later, he was much influenced by Poussin and Rubens. Like Bassano, he was a great animal painter. He was in Rome by 1634, when he was in the Academy of St Luke, and he remained there until at least 1650, with visits to Naples and Genoa. It was at this time that he was influenced by Poussin. About 1648/50 he began to work for the Mantuan Court, which perhaps explains the influence of Rubens, who had worked there some forty years earlier. His latest works have a deep mystical fervour, but he is principally remembered as the inventor of a kind of drawing in thin washes of oil-paint, and, more important, of the 'monotype'. He may also have invented soft-ground etching, of which he was certainly an early exponent. Excellent examples of both drawings and monotypes are in the Royal Collection at Windsor, and other works are in Bergamo, Cambridge (Fitzwilliam), Dresden, Dublin, Genoa, Hartford Conn., Los Angeles, Madrid, Montpellier, Munich, Ottawa, Paris (Louvre), Rome (Doria), Rouen and Turin.

He painted landscapes and battle scenes of the Revolution, but was primarily a portraitist. Although his style became softer and more sophisticated after studying with West in London, his work generally has a sincerity and freshness of vision that makes him one of the finest American artists of the 18th century. His presentation of character is extremely forthright and his portraits convey the immense pride his New England sitters took in their possessions. Earl's personal life was a disaster. He was imprisoned for debt and died an alcoholic after deserting both of his wives in turn. Other members of his family were artists, notably his brother James (1761-96) and his son Ralph E. W.

His heyday came between 1898 and 1902 when he produced designs for jewellery, textiles, porcelain and furniture, including exhibits in the famous Art Nouveau Bing pavilion (destroyed) at the Exposition Universelle in Paris in 1900. In 1902 Colonna returned to North America and worked for 20 years as an interior decorator and designer in Canada and the USA. In 1923, he retired to the south of France but was still active as a designer and artist. "

41617,Lattanzio Gambara,1520,1574,"Italian painter. It is generally agreed that he received his early training with Giulio Campi in Cremona, where he developed his style, derived from Lombard and Emilian Mannerism. In 1549 Gambara returned to Brescia, where he became an assistant to Girolamo Romanino and married the latter's daughter in 1556. During the 1550s he collaborated with Romanino on the fresco cycles in the Averoldi and Bargnani palaces in Brescia, where he made some accommodation in his style to Romanino's, though demonstrating his innate eclecticism. His first important independent commissions were the façade frescoes (c. 1557) on the Case del Gambero (Brescia). Here, Gambara fused the decorative elegance of Parmigianino and Camillo Boccaccino with the Michelangelesque qualities of Giulio Romano and Pordenone. He was a prolific fresco painter and draughtsman, and after Romanino's death in 1560 he became the leading artist in Brescia. In 1561 he frescoed four scenes from the Apocalypse in the Broletto Palace in Brescia (destroyed), which reflected strongly the influence of Giulio Romano. This is true also of his Nativity  (c. 1561-68; Brescia, Santi Faustino e Giovità), where an academic dryness begins to appear. From 1567 to 1573 Gambara was engaged in frescoing the nave arcade and internal façade of Parma Cathedral together with the Cremonese painter Bernardino Gatti. These frescoes, as well as the contemporary frescoes in Cremona Cathedral, are in a turgid Mannerist style, filled with large figures and complicated foreshortening. He died while executing the vault frescoes in San Lorenzo, Brescia. "

After the death of her mother in 1775 she left Grasse to join her elder sister Marie-Anne and her sister's husband Jean-Honoré Fragonard in their quarters in the Louvre in Paris. Marguerite became Fragonard's protégé and lived for the next 30 years in the Louvre, where she was exposed to the greatest art and artists of the past and present. By 1785 she had already established a reputation as a gifted genre painter, the first French woman to do so, and by the late 1780s came to be considered one of the leading women artists in France, the equal of Adelaide Labille-Guiard, Anne Vallayer-Coster and Elisabeth Vigée-Lebrun. Although she also produced oil portraits, portrait miniatures, and etchings, Marguerite Gérard is best known for her intimate domestic genre scenes. By her mid-twenties Gérard had developed her signature style, which featured painstakingly accurate details rendered with subtly blended brush strokes, both traits borrowed from 17th-century Dutch genre specialists, notably Gabriel Metsu. Gérard's work is not only technically impressive but also practical: these relatively small-scale, portable canvases were designed to appeal to wealthy collectors who preferred to display in their homes meticulously painted still lifes and genre scenes rather than large history paintings. The numerous engraved versions of Gérard's paintings made them accessible to less affluent art lovers and helped increase her reputation. "

In 1883 he travelled with his fellow student and lifelong friend Edmund Charles Tarbell to Paris, where they both studied at the Académie Julian for three years with Gustave Boulanger and Jules Lefebvre. Benson travelled with Tarbell to Italy in 1884 and to Italy, Belgium, Germany and Brittany the following year. When he returned home, Benson became an instructor at the Portland (ME) School of Art, and after his marriage to Ellen Perry Peirson in 1888 he settled in Salem, MA. Benson taught with Tarbell at the Museum School in Boston from 1889 until their resignation over policy differences in 1913. Benson rejoined the staff the next year and taught intermittently as a visiting instructor until 1930.

41494,Guglielmo della Porta,1500,1577,"Italian sculptor, son or nephew of Gian Giacomo della Porta (active 1513, d. ca. 1554, Genova). He was part of an Italian family of sculptors, stone masons and architects, active from the 15th century to the 17th. Originally they came from Porlezza on Lake Lugano, but they were active in the masons' lodges of Milan Cathedral and the Certosa di Pavia from the 1470s. Around 1500, Antonio della Porta set up a workshop in Genoa, where he collaborated with, among others, his nephew Pace Gagini of the Gagini family of sculptors and stone masons, producing sculpture that was exported to France. Guglielmo must have learnt his craft in Milan in the 1520s, at the time when Gian Giacomo was a member of the stonemasons' lodge of Milan Cathedral. Around 1530, in Genoa, Guglielmo must have met Perino del Vaga, who had a decisive influence on his style. With Gian Giacomo and Niccolò da Corte he worked on the baldacchino, completed in 1532, in the chapel of San Giovanni Battista, Genoa Cathedral. A number of reliefs of prophets on the socles of the baldacchino have been identified as Guglielmo's earliest works. As an independent sculptor, Guglielmo worked on several figures for the Cybo monument, a commission begun in 1533. Guglielmo's contributions to this monument are the figures of Giuliano Cybo (rediscovered in 1955) and of Abraham. According to Vasari, Guglielmo moved to Rome in 1537. However, his name does not feature on any documents there until 1546. Initially, he worked with Perino del Vaga and produced designs for stucco decorations, now lost, for the Cappella Massimi in Trinità dei Monti. The Farnese family commissioned him to restore antique sculptures, including the Farnese Hercules, which he restored in 1547 after its discovery by Cardinal Alessandro Farnese in 1540. In the same year he was nominated 'Piombatore Apostolico' - officially in charge of the lead used for making papal bulls - in succession to Sebastiano del Piombo, and thereafter is known as Fra Guglielmo della Porta. From c. 1544 Guglielmo was patronized by the Farnese pope Paul III, producing bronze and marble busts of him. Guglielmo was probably commissioned to construct the funerary monument to Paul III in 1547. In 1575 his ambitious free-standing tomb was temporarily erected in the nave of St Peter's, but by 1588 it had been dismantled and reconstructed in a different form, in a recess in a crossing pier. Guglielmo was probably responsible for at least the design of a number of other funerary monuments in Rome. Guglielmo's numerous bronze sculptures include 16 mythological reliefs after Ovid and are held in several collections (e.g. Judgement of Paris, Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna; Bacchanalian Feast, Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York) as well as crucifixes and representations of scenes from the Passion. The Farnese Table (Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York), which was once attributed to Giacomo da Vignola, is probably by Guglielmo. Guglielmo also produced some architectural designs for San Silvestro al Quirinale in Rome. An outline for a treatise on architecture shows that Guglielmo had a thorough knowledge of architectural matters.  "

He returned to Amsterdam after a brief period in Antwerp. In 1659 he married Marieke de Jouderville, daughter of the painter Isaac de Jouderville; they had 12 children. Frederik was strongly influenced by the work of the second generation of Dutch Italianates, particularly Asselijn and Jan Both. His landscapes also show similarities with the late work of Adam Pynacker. Dirck Helmbreker, Johannes Lingelbach, Adriaen van de Velde and Nicolaes Berchem all provided staffage for his paintings. "
54383,Vincenzo Gemito,1852,1929,"Italian sculptor and draughtsman. He was a child of the streets, who was adopted by a poor artisan. In 1861, at only nine years of age, he entered the workshop of the sculptor Emanuele Caggiano (1837-1905) as an assistant and dogsbody. Around this time he formed a close friendship with the painter Antonio Mancini; together they frequented the studio of Stanislao Lista (1824-1908), a sculptor and painter of a more advanced tendency. There Gemito learnt to model in clay and wax, and he is supposed to have been encouraged by Lista to study the life of the streets. After leaving Lista's studio Gemito set up independently in an abandoned convent, working alongside Mancini and the sculptors Achille D'Orsi and Giovanni Battista Amendola (1848-1887). Gemito's Neapolitan Fisherboy at the 1877 Paris Salon brought him acclaim and commissions, and he stayed for three years. Upon returning, he studied antique sculpture at the Naples Museum and incorporated Hellenistic influences into his work. Reviving the lost-wax process of casting used in the Renaissance, Gemito built his own bronze foundry in 1883. Three years later, he completed his only important public commission, a marble statue of Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor. In 1887 Gemito suffered a mental collapse and withdrew to one room, concentrating entirely on drawing and seeing few friends. Around 1909 he resumed sculpting, basing his works on the ancients with a delicacy and detail that ultimately derived from his drawings. "

4124,Eugène Carrière,1849,1906,"French painter and lithographer. He studied advertising lithography in Strasbourg from 1864, and also at the studio of Alexandre Cabanel. In order to survive, he worked both at his regular profession and as a decorative painter. Fame and commercial success came to him in the 1880s. He was one of the main representatives of Symbolism in France. The motifs of his landscapes, religious histories, portraits and figures were in reduced colours and a mysterious semi-darkness with blurred contours, as if seen through a veil. He is best known for his spiritual interpretations of maternity and family life. He also painted some large canvases for the Sorbonne and the Hôtel de Ville, Paris. Among his works are many notable portraits, including those of Verlaine, Daudet, and Edmond de Goncourt (all in the Louvre). "

743,Fra Angelico,1387,1455,"Florentine painter, a Dominican friar, originally named Guido di Pietro. Although in popular tradition he has been seen as 'not an artist properly so-called but an inspired saint', (Ruskin), Angelico was in fact a highly professional artist, who was in touch with the most advanced developments in contemporary Florentine art and in later life travelled extensively for prestigious commissions. Angelico entered a Dominican convent in Fiesole in 1418 and became a friar using the name Giovanni da Fiesole. Although his teacher is unknown, he apparently began his career as an illuminator of missals and other religious books. He began to paint altarpieces and other panels; among his important early works are the Madonna of the Star (c. 1424, San Marco, Florence) and San Domenico Altarpiece with a predella representing Christ in Glory Surrounded by Saints and Angels (National Gallery, London), which depicts more than 250 distinct figures. Among other works of that period are two of the Coronation of the Virgin (Uffizi, Florence and Louvre, Paris) and The Deposition and The Last Judgment (San Marco). His mature style is first seen in the Madonna of the Linen Weavers (1433, San Marco), which features a border with 12 music-making angels. In 1436 some of the Dominican friars of Fiesole moved to the convent of San Marco in Florence, which had recently been rebuilt by Michelozzo. Angelico, sometimes aided by assistants, painted many frescoes for the cloister, chapter house, and entrances to the 20 cells on the upper corridors. The most impressive of these are The Crucifixion, Noli Me Tangere, and Transfiguration. His altarpiece for San Marco (1439?) is one of the first representations of what is known as a Sacred Conversation: the Madonna flanked by angels and saints who seem to share a common space. In 1445 Angelico was summoned to Rome by Pope Eugenius IV to paint frescoes for the now destroyed Chapel of the Sacrament in the Vatican. In 1447, with his pupil Benozzo Gozzoli, he painted frescoes for the cathedral in Orvieto. His last important works, frescoes for the chapel of Pope Nicholas in the Vatican, are Scenes from the Lives of Saints Stephen and Lawrence (1447-1449), probably partly painted from his designs by assistants. Angelico died in Rome and was buried in the church of S. Maria sopra Minerva, where his tombstone still exists. His most important pupil was Benozzo Gozzoli and he had considerable influence on Italian painting. He painted numerous altarpieces as well as frescos, several outstanding examples being in the S. Marco museum. His particular grace and sweetness stimulated the school of Perugia, and Fra Bartolommeo, who followed him into S. Marco in 1500, had something of his restraint and grandeur. Vasari, who referred to Fra Giovanni as a simple and most holy man, popularized the use of the name Angelico for him, but he says it is the name by which he was always known, and it was certainly used as early as 1469. The painter has long been called 'Beato Angelico' (the Blessed Angelico), but his beatification was not made official by the Vatican until 1984. Angelico combined the influence of the elegantly decorative International Gothic style of Gentile da Fabriano with the more realistic style of such Renaissance masters as the painter Masaccio and the sculptors Donatello and Ghiberti, all of whom worked in Florence. Angelico was also aware of the theories of perspective proposed by Leon Battista Alberti. Angelico's representation of devout facial expressions and his use of colour to heighten emotion are particularly effective. His skill in creating monumental figures, representing motion, and suggesting deep space through the use of linear perspective, especially in the Roman frescoes, mark him as one of the foremost painters of the Renaissance.

34081,Donato Creti,1671,1749,"Italian painter and draughtsman. His individual and poetic art represents, with that of Marcantonio Franceschini, the last significant expression of the classical-idealist strain in Bolognese painting. His activity was almost wholly confined to Bologna, where he painted decorative frescoes, altarpieces and easel pictures for private collectors. Two qualities are paramount: a perfected finesse of handling and poetic suggestiveness of situation and mood. He sought the ideal beauty of the individual figure and was thus at his best in meditative pictures with few figures; his subjects combine grace of form and precision of contour with flesh that attains the surface delicacy of porcelain and colours that have a mineral-like refulgence. He was a prolific draughtsman with a distinct personal manner, who drew for pleasure as well as to prepare his compositions, usually using a quill-pen and producing shadowing by hatching. In Bologna he was a pupil of Lorenzo Pasinelli. Among his followers were Aureliano Milani, Francesco Monti, and Ercole Graziani the Younger. "

He studied with his father, Jean-Théodore Fantin-Latour (1805-1875), from 1846 and then with Horace Lecocq de Boisbaudran (1802-1897) at the Petite École de Dessin in Paris from 1850 to 1856. His apprenticeship was based on copying the Old Masters before beginning to study from nature. He had a growing enthusiasm for the Italian painters, particularly Titian and Veronese, whom he copied in the Louvre from 1852. The Dream (1854; Grenoble, Musée Grenoble) is one of the first of a series of imaginary scenes in which Fantin-Latour concentrated on the theme of vision, which he later continued in his representations of scenes from various operas. He met François Bonvin and Félix Bracquemond in 1853 and went to the École des Beaux-Arts in 1854, but he left before the end of the year. He began to paint the life around him and did a series of self-portraits from 1854 to 1861, such as Self-portrait Seated at the Easel (1858; Berlin, Alte Nationalgalerie) and Self-portrait (1859; Grenoble, Musée Grenoble). Though he associated with progressive artists (Gustave Courbet, Eugène Delacroix, Édouard Manet), he was a traditionalist best known for his portraits and still-lifes with flowers. His portrait groups, reminiscent of 17th-century Dutch guild portraits, depict literary and artistic persons of the time; his flower paintings were especially popular in England, thanks to James McNeill Whistler and John Everett Millais, who found patrons to support him. His later years were devoted to lithography. "

40587,Battista Franco,1510,1561,"Battista Franco (also Baptista Veneziano or Il Semolei) was an Italian painter, engraver and draughtsman. Giorgio Vasari, who knew Franco well and who is the chief source for his life, claimed that Franco was born in 1498; however, later writers placed his birth in 1510, and the latter date seems more likely. Although Venetian by birth, by the age of 20 Franco was in Rome. He painted an allegory of the Battle of Montemurlo now in the Pitti Palace (1537), and a fresco of the Arrest of John the Baptist for the Oratory of San Giovanni Decollato (1541). From 1545-51 he painted in Urbino. His painting, in the Mannerist style, was heavily indebted to Michelangelo; but his drawings and etchings have far more verve and originality. He returned to Venice, where he helped fresco the ceiling of the Biblioteca Marciana (library). He painted a series of panels, including a Baptism of Christ (Barbaro chapel), for the walls and vault of the Grimani chapel in the church San Francesco della Vigna in Venice. He painted the Raising of Lazarus in the Ducal Palace. While in Rome, he devoted himself to making drawings after the Antique and particularly after the works of Michelangelo; he was one of the first to copy the frescoes in the Sistine Chapel. At this date he invariably worked in pen and made no original drawings. However, he subsequently made his own, more spontaneous studies, such as the Man in a Cloak (c. 1557-61; London, British Museum), in pen and wash over black chalk, and a total of about 100 drawings by his hand are now known. He also made many prints, often combining etching with engraving, as in St Jerome (c. 1554), printed from an enormous single plate (872 x 480 mm), showing an energetic, muscular saint at his devotions. He may have been, along with Girolamo Genga, one of the mentors of Federico Barocci. "

There he learned the etching and developed a special passion for the landscape. In this time, Erhard closely followed the artists Johann Adam Klein (1792-1875) and Georg Christoph Wilder (1797-1855). He undertook excursions with them to the surrounding areas, to study nature. The Russian troops, who were frequently drawn through Nuremberg from 1812 to 1814, gave him the opportunity to draw horses and military groups. In 1816 Erhard traveled to Vienna together with Johann Adam Klein and worked in the surrounding landscape. In 1817 he traveled with friends in the Schneeberg region, and in the following year he visited Upper Austria, Salzburg and the Pinzgau. The result of these journeys were numerous landscape drawings and etchings, which he also made for art publishers. In 1819 Erhard went to Rome. There he did landscape studies and worked for various artisans. Soon, however, a severe mental illness befell him, whose signs had already appeared in Germany. He committed suicide in January 1822. "

15877,Charles Rennie Mackintosh,1868,1928,"Scottish architect, designer, and painter. At the peak of the Arts and Crafts Movement in Scotland, Charles Rennie Mackintosh was the founder of the Glasgow School, an outstanding architecture and decoration style, forerunner of Modern Movement in Scotland. In 1884, he trained as an architect in a local firm and studied art and design at evening classes at the Glasgow School of Art. In 1890, he established his own practice, in 1894, he founded the group called The Four, with fellow artists at the art school: Charles Rennie Mackintosh, Herbert MacNair, and the sisters Margaret Macdonald and Frances Macdonald. Influenced by Continental Art Nouveau, Japanese art, Symbolism and new-Gothic styles, they successfully exhibited metalwork, furniture and illustrations in Glasgow, London, Vienna and Turin. Mackintosh created most of his works and innovative designs within a short period of intense activity between 1890 and 1911. He collaborated to the 1900 Vienna Secession and with Austrian architect-designer Josef Hoffmann, greatly influencing his work. In 1902, he presented his Mackintosh room furniture at the Turin International Exhibition; he later designed houses and various Tea-Rooms interior decorations. Mackintosh's chief architectural projects were the Glasgow School of Art (1896-1909), considered the first original example of Art Nouveau architecture in Great Britain; two unrealized projects - the 1901 International exhibition, Glasgow (1898), and ""Haus eines Kunstfreundes"" (1901); Windyhill, Kilmacolm (1899-1901), and Hill House, Helensburgh (1902); the Willow Tea Rooms, Glasgow (1904); and Scotland Street School, Glasgow (1904-06). Although all have some traditional characteristics, they reveal a mind of exceptional inventiveness and aesthetic perception. By 1914 he had virtually ceased to practice and after that devoted himself to watercolour painting. Although Mackintosh was nearly forgotten for several decades, the late 20th century saw a revival of interest in his work. The stark simplicity of some of his furniture designs, in particular, appealed to contemporary taste, and reproductions of Mackintosh chairs and settees began to be manufactured. The Mackintosh House in Glasgow was reconstructed and opened to the public as a museum in the late 1970s. Mackintosh's designs, stylized flowers and decorative elements have inspired many modern graphic works, furniture re-editions, as well as jewellery and silverware designs. "
41683,Leone Leoni,1509,1590,"Italian Mannerist sculptor who worked in many parts of Italy and in the service of the emperor Charles V in Germany and the Netherlands. He was trained as a goldsmith but none of his works in that medium survives. From 1538 to 1540 he was coin engraver to Pope Paul III (Alessandro Farnese), but he was then condemned to the galleys for conspiring to murder the papal jeweller. He was released in 1541 and for most of the rest of his life was master of the imperial mint in Milan. His sculpture consists mainly of portraits - both medals and busts. Many of his works for the emperor were sent to Spain, where his son Pompeo, who moved there in about 1556, gave them the finishing touches. The most important was a group of 27 bronze statues (finished 1582) for the high altar of the Escorial. "

Francesco Maffei, Matteo Ponzone, and Filippo Zanimberti were among his pupils. "

36478,Ker-Xavier Roussel,1867,1944,"French painter, printmaker and decorative artist. While still at the Lycée Condorcet in Paris, he met Edouard Vuillard (whose sister Marie he married in 1893), Maurice Denis and Paul Sérusier. Once they had finished their studies, they all went together to the Académie Julian, where Pierre Bonnard, Georges Lacombe (1868-1916), Paul Ranson and Félix Vallotton were already enrolled. Dissatisfied with the teaching of William-Adolphe Bouguereau and Jules Lefèbvre, they left the Académie in 1890, two years after they had begun to meet together as the Nabis. Roussel took part in exhibitions at the Café Volpini in 1889 and the Le Barc de Boutteville gallery in 1891. At that time, his pictures applied the rules of Synthetism outlined by Sérusier - flat planes of repeated colour encircled by dark lines forming a harmonious rhythm. Like the other Nabis, Roussel did not restrict himself to easel painting but also produced murals, stained glass and lithographs: the colour lithograph the Training the Dog, which he contributed to the anthology Amours (Paris, 1892-98) published by the dealer Ambroise Vollard, was the first of several such projects in which he developed the Symbolist character of his work. The 12 lithographs he contributed to another Vollard publication, Album de Paysages (Paris, 1899), vividly expressed the pantheist vision of nature that was to characterize his later work. Because of illness, Roussel was forced to leave Paris and to spend more time in his property at L'Etang-la-Ville. There he was visited by friends, particularly Sérusier. His participation in the first Salon des Indépendants in 1901 was still marked by Synthetist precepts, but his pictorial break with the avant-garde had probably already been made. Abandoning flat planes of colour within an enclosing line, he reverted to a Neo-Impressionist technique characterized by broad, clearly visible brushstrokes, which were more suggestive than descriptive, and by an emphasis on tonal relationships within an overall impression of colour. He applied such methods to rustic landscapes often inhabited by mythological figures. Roussel retained his interest in the decorative arts, in 1913 painting the backdrop for the Théâtre des Champs-Elysées in Paris and the huge mural painting Pax Nutrix for the Palais des Nations in Geneva, followed by The Dance for the Palais de Chaillot in Paris on the occasion of the Exposition Universelle in 1937.

57491,Ludwig Ferdinand Schnorr von Carolsfeld,1788,1853,
22591,Salomon van Ruysdael,1595,1670,"Dutch landscape painter of the Baroque style, uncle of the landscape artist Jacob van Ruisdael.

Originally named de Goyer, as was his brother Isaack (also a painter and the father of Jacob van Ruisdael), Salomon entered the Haarlem Guild of St Luke in 1628. His first dated pictures are from 1627. He spent his whole life in Haarlem, where he was head of the guild in 1648.

Van Ruysdael's early works - winter scenes - continue the tradition of Esaias van de Velde, and his early landscapes are based on the colour schemes and compositions of Pieter Molyn; it has been suggested that he may have studied with either or both painters. At least by 1628 he is mentioned as a landscape painter of Haarlem. Unlike certain other landscape painters of the period, his nephew among them, van Ruysdael generally painted actual landscapes of such places as Arnhem, Dordrecht, and Utrecht, sometimes combining motifs from different places in one picture. His early river landscapes of the 1630s, which are characterized by diagonal compositions of the dunes, are similar in composition and use of colour to the celebrated river scenes of his contemporary Jan van Goyen. Experts agree that van Ruysdael's most powerful work was done after 1645. His command of the landscape elements - great trees anchoring one side of the composition, distant views that draw the eye, and a vast expanse of sky and clouds - seems more assured, and his use of colour for effect more brilliant. From that point van Ruysdael became increasingly interested in light effects and decorative elements in his compositions. Critics have speculated that his change of style was in part owing to the influence of several Dutch painters (such as Jan Both) who were returning to Holland from study in Italy. Many of van Ruysdael's later works are monumental in format and design, and they exhibit a masterly rendering of atmospheric effects. Though his landscapes are most characteristic of his work, between 1659 and 1662 van Ruysdael also painted a number of excellent still-lifes of game. His son Jacob Salomonszoon (1635-81) was also a landscape artist. "

He was one of the most significant and influential artists active in Rome in the first quarter of the 18th century. The son of a Florentine artisan, he trained in his native city under the direction of Anton Domenico Gabbiani and thoroughly absorbed the style of Pietro da Cortona and his late Baroque successors. In 1690 he left Florence for Rome, where in 1692 he made his artistic début in the annual St Bartholomew's Day exhibition with a monumental painting of God Cursing Cain after the Murder of Abel (Kedleston Hall, Derbys). He quickly rose to prominence and in 1694 was elected to the Accademia di S Luca. He produced a variety of works for the leading Roman families - the Torri, Colonna, Pallavicini, Barberini and Odescalchi - and enjoyed the patronage of Pope Clement XI, Cardinal Pietro Ottoboni, Cardinal Carlo Agosto Fabbroni and Padre Antonin Cloche, Master General of the Dominican Order. He was invited to participate in the most important papal commission to painters in Rome in the first quarter of the 18th century, that for the series of Old Testament prophets above the nave arcade in S Giovanni in Laterano; his contribution was Isaiah (1718; in situ). With many of the same artists who painted for Pope Clement XI - Giuseppe Bartolomeo Chiari, Francesco Trevisani, Andrea Procaccini, Sebastiano Conca, Luigi Garzi - he was also involved in the major secular commission of the time in Rome, a series of ceilings in the Palazzo de Carolis (now the Banca di Roma), contributing an Allegory of Diana (c. 1720; in situ). In Florence he enjoyed the support of Grand Duke Cosimo III de' Medici, and it was through his connection with the Tuscan court that his artistic reputation spread to France, England and Germany. "

He is considered the most important architect of the late eighteenth century in England. Together with his brother James (1730-1794), he transformed Palladian Neoclassicism in England into the airy, light, elegant style that bears their name (Adam style). His major architectural works include public buildings (especially in London), and his designs were used for the interiors of such country mansions as Syon House in Middlesex (now in Hounslow, London). He spent a fairly long period in Rome between 1754-58 where he came to know the famous architectural theoretician and engraver Giovanni Battista Piranesi and the French draftsman Charles-Louis Clérisseau. In 1755 Robert Adam began a long association with Charles-Louis Clérisseau, first as his student later as his employer. Clérisseau assisted Adam in his study of ancient architectural and decorative forms and their adaptation to a new architectural style. Adam also led an expedition to Dalmatia in order to record the precise measurements of Diocletian's palace at Spalato (now Split). The results of this were published in 1764 under the title The Ruins of Spalato. He settled in London at the end of the 1750s. After his return to England, Adam was mainly involved in the decoration of existing interiors. Syon House, Middlesex gives some idea of the way in which he was able to interpret and enhance motifs from a wide variety of classical sources. "

33768,Hans Brosamer,1495,1554,"German painter and printmaker. One of the German printmakers of the 1500s known as the ""Little Masters"" because of their finely executed, small-scale prints, Hans Brosamer was instrumental in raising the standard of German Protestant book illustration. He worked in Fulda from about 1520 to 1545, painting portraits of distinguished local citizens and designing engravings and woodcuts. Brownish flesh tones, green backgrounds, and an interest in fine materials characterized his portraits. By the time he moved to Erfurt around 1546, Brosamer, like many other struggling German painters, devoted himself exclusively to designs for both copper engravings and woodcuts. His woodcuts illustrated Martin Luther's Wittenberg Bible and Luther's Frankfurt Catechism, both from 1550, and his engravings range from Christian, mythological, and classical themes to genre scenes. Following Netherlandish Mannerist models, Brosamer depicted ambitious architectural backgrounds with groups of figures. He used very closely hatched lines to achieve the dense texture of his engravings. He designed both on wood and copper, although he was properly a wood-engraver, signing himself on his portrait of the Landgrave of Hesse, 'Formschneider zu Erfurt,' where he resided during the latter part of his life. In his copper engravings his style is somewhat modern, and resembles rather the engravers who copied the designs of others than those of the earlier period, who invented their own subjects. He sometimes marked his plates with his name, and sometimes with a cipher. "

41904,Jan van Os,1744,1808,"Painter and poet, part of a Dutch family of artists. The dynasty was founded by Jan van Os and included his sons Pieter Gerardus van Os, painter and etcher, and Georgius van Os, painter, his daughter, the fruit and flower painter Maria Margaretha van Os (1780-1862), and his grandson, the painter of landscapes with horses and cattle Pieter Frederik van Os (1808-1892). After moving to The Hague at an early age, Jan van Os was apprenticed to Aert Schouman. In 1773 he became a member of the painters' club Pictura. Two years later he married the deaf-mute pen portraitist Susanna de La Croix, daughter of the French portraitist Pierre Frédéric de La Croix (1709-82), also a deaf-mute. Although van Os started his career with paintings of seascapes in the manner of Jan van de Cappelle and Willem van de Velde the Younger - a genre that he continued to employ throughout his life - he was most famous for his asymmetrically composed pyramidal still-lifes of fruit and flowers in the manner of Jan van Huysum. These are set, like those of van Huysum, on a marble ledge, often with a terracotta vase, against a pale green landscape background. Van Os acquired an international reputation for his still-lifes: his work was valued highly both in England, where he exhibited at the Society of Arts in London from 1773 to 1791, and in France and Germany. Dated flower and fruit pieces survive from 1765 onwards. "

40616,Jan van Goyen,1596,1656,"Dutch painter, one of the foremost pioneers of realistic landscape painting in the Netherlands. His earliest works are heavily indebted to his master Esaias van de Velde, but he then created a distinctive type of monochrome landscape in browns and greys with touches of vivid blue or red to catch the eye; gnarled oaks; wide plains, usually seen from a height; low horizons and clouded skies. He was one of the first painters to capture the quality of the light and air in a scene and to suggest the movement of clouds. Most of his paintings seem to be based on drawings made as he travelled about the countryside, and he evidently used the same drawings again and again because the same motifs recur repeatedly in his works. His finest work has a sense of poetic calm as well as great freshness and luminosity of atmosphere. Van Goyen worked in his native Leiden, Haarlem, and The Hague, where he died. He was hugely prolific and had many pupils and imitators. With Salomon van Ruysdael, whose paintings are often virtually indistinguishable from his, he was the outstanding master of the 'tonal' phase of Dutch landscape painting, when the depiction of atmosphere was the artist's prime concern.

44340,Ferdinando Tacca,1619,1686,"Italian sculptor and scenographer, son of Pietro Tacca. He applied his artistic and engineering talents to a variety of projects. Trained as a sculptor, he also designed theaters, stage sets, machinery, and court spectacles. He received his first training from his father and in 1640 also assumed his father's position at the Medici court as sculptor to Ferdinand II, grand duke of Tuscany. As director of the sculpture workshop and foundry in Borgo Pinti, which he inherited from his father, Tacca produced large bronze equestrian monuments, figural groups, and smaller-scale works for the Medicis in the 1640s. He helped complete in 1640 the bronze Equestrian Statue of King Philip IV of Spain in Madrid. He created the Crucifix for the Cathedral of Prato and the Fontana di Bacchino, located in the city's main piazza. The fountain (1659-1665) depicts young Bacchus in bronze sitting around bunches of grapes. His bronze relief of the Martyrdom of St Stephen in San Stefano, Florence (1656), points back via Francavilla and Giambologna to the illusionism of Ghiberti's Porta del Paradiso. When Medici patronage of sculptural works declined around 1650, Tacca embarked on a second successful career as a stage designer and engineer. On the request of Cardinal Giovanni Carlo de' Medici, he presented a design for the first theatre in Florence. He also designed stage sets and theater machinery. His experience in the theatre led naturally to designing spectacles for the court, and in 1656 he was appointed the designer for Medici festivities and religious rites. A few years later, still enjoying Medici patronage, Tacca was appointed engineer of the Medici buildings and fortifications. "

41512,Valerio Belli,1463,1546,"Italian gem-engraver, goldsmith and medallist. The most important part of his career was spent in Rome, where he worked for Clement VII and his successor Paul III. He also spent a short period in Venice, returning from there to Vicenza in 1530 and remaining in the latter city for most of the time until his death. In Rome he was a well-established member of artistic and literary circles, associating, for example, with Michelangelo and the humanist scholar Pietro Bembo. No specimens of his work as a goldsmith survive, but he is called 'aurifex' in contemporary documents and may have made the settings for his carved gems. Belli specialized in cutting gems and crystal and in carving dies for coins and medals. His best-known works are those made for his papal patrons, many consisting of or incorporating carvings in rock crystal or semiprecious stones. The most splendid of these is a silver-gilt casket adorned with 24 carvings in crystal showing scenes from the Passion. It was completed in 1532 and sent by Clement VII to France as a wedding present on the occasion of the marriage of the Dauphin, later Henry II, to Catherine de' Medici. Bronze plaquettes after Belli's works are sometimes found, produced by taking plaster or sulphur casts. Plaquettes or casts of this kind can be helpful in suggesting the form of lost works, as may be the case with the missing engraved crystals from a rock crystal Crucifix (Victoria and Albert Museum, London), which was one of his last commissions from Clement VII. Belli is also known to have been connected with the papal mint, although no specific issues of coins can be attributed to him, and the remains of his work as an official medallist are scanty. The best known of his works in this field is a private rather than an official work, a medal bearing a portrait of Pietro Bembo (e.g. National Gallery of Art, Washington), with a reverse representing him reclining in a pastoral setting. Specimens also survive of a portrait medal that is almost certainly a self-portrait from dies engraved by Belli. This is known in several versions (e.g. National Gallery of Art, Washington), each bearing a classicizing mythological scene on its reverse. "

40483,Philippe de Champaigne,1602,1674,"Apart from Vouet, Champaigne was the most important painter active in Paris in the middle years of the 17th century. He was born and trained in Brussels. He arrived in Paris in 1621. Throughout his career he made many official commissions, for monasteries, for the Church, and for Louis XIII.  He collaborated with Nicolas Poussin in decorating the Luxembourg Palace, then worked for the queen mother, Marie de Medicis, for Louis XIII, and after 1635 primarily for the king's chief minister, Cardinal Armand Richelieu, for whom he decorated the Palais Royal, the dome of the Sorbonne, and other buildings. His art has not been studied in depth until recently, and has undergone radical reassessment: instead of being seen as an exponent of dry Classicism, he is now seen to epitomize the whole epoch. As a portraitist, his vivid depictions of Cardinal Richelieu show how he was able to seize on the essential characteristics of the autocrat, while his portraits of other, now unidentifiable contemporaries are much more sympathetic. In the first part of his career, as a painter of religious pictures, he executed a number of large altarpieces that shows his Flemish origin. This is especially true of such Rubens-inspired works as the Adoration of the Shepherds in the Wallace Collection, London. Later in life, Champaigne changed his art dramatically when he came under the influence of the Jansenist movement. His paralysed daughter was miraculously cured in the Jansenist nunnery of Port-Royal, and to mark the event Champaigne painted his celebrated but untypical Ex-Voto (Louvre, Paris). Champaigne's art was much more varied than is usually thought, and his achievement spans almost fifty years, from the mid-1620s to his death in 1674. He was one of the fourteen founder-members of the Academy in 1648. "

34238,Marco Dente da Ravenna,,,"Italian engraver. He was active in Rome during the early 16th century. Some early writers confused him with Silvestro da Ravenna, and his family name was unknown until its rediscovery by Zani. He studied with Marcantonio Raimondi and was strongly influenced by the latter's style. He often collaborated with Agostino Veneziano, another Marcantonio student who also had some influence on Dente's work. Dente was evidently born in Ravenna, although his birth date is undocumented. His earliest signed and dated print is inscribed 1515, suggesting that he was active from c. 1510 and was probably born in the late 15th century. He was killed in the Sack of Rome in 1527. Dente produced over 60 reproductive engravings, primarily after works by Raphael and his circle and after the Antique. Occasionally he made engravings after other artists, such as the Massacre of the Innocents (1520-21) after Baccio Bandinelli. He engraved several copies after Marcantonio prints that were based on Raphael designs. Two examples of this, the Massacre of the Innocents and Judgement of Paris, were considered by Bartsch to be among Dente's best works. Other engravings may derive directly from Raphael drawings, such as the Venus Wounded by the Rose's Thorn. Dente's only print to include an inscription with his full name (MARCVS RAVENAS), rather than a monogram, is his engraving after the Laokoon, which shows the antique statue before its restoration. "

He was a prolific painter who, with a team of artists and craftsmen, decorated palaces and public buildings in Rome, Venice, many cities in Emilia Romagna (especially Faenza), and in France. Felice Giani played an interesting role in the development of the Neoclassical style and was in touch with many prominent people on the international cultural scene. He moved to Rome when he was 20 where he immediately found work in the last phase of decorating Palazzo Doria (1780). Although he was already interested in the classical ornamental repertory, the young Giani flirted with visionary Romanticism. In the work that he produced subsequently in Rome and Faenza (Palazzo Zarchia Laderchi and Palazzo Milzetti, his masterpiece), the dynamic flair that had characterized his style before 1800 did not disappear. It seemed rather to be redirected toward re-reading classical antiquity in an eclectic way. The combination of a stay in Paris and the Napoleonic years gave his style one final thrust. He made a second journey to Paris where he painted frescos in the villa of the Secretary of State of the Kingdom of Italy. This commission brought him international renown and put him in touch with the various currents in French painting at the start of the nineteenth century. Giani's work belongs to the historicist phase that straddled the end of the eighteenth and the start of the nineteenth centuries. His fantasy and ornamental taste took him beyond definitions of Neoclassical or Romantic. "

2530,Jacques Blanchard,1600,1638,"French painter. Nothing seems to be known of his work before he left for Rome at the age of twenty-four. After two years he moved to Venice, where he remained for two more years. It was there that his style was formed. He then went to Turin, where he worked for the Dukes of Savoy, before returning to France 1628. It is from the brief but productive period after his return that all his dated works survive. They show him to stand quite apart from his contemporaries, not only in his painting style but also in his choice of sensual  subject-matter, for example the Bacchanal at Nancy. The chief influences were the sixteenth century painters, especially Titian and Tintoretto with their rich, warm colours, and Veronese, whose blond and silvery colour and limpid light he used most effectively in his small religious and mythological subjects. The several versions of Charity, depicted as a young woman with two or three children, are excellent examples of his tenderness of colour handling, and of a softness of sentiment nearer to the 18th than to the 17th century. He was also a sensitive portrait painter, and played a leading part in French painting of the 1630s. "

41011,Agostino Tassi,1575,1644,"The son of a furrier named Domenico Tassi, Agostino Tassi, who aspired to nobility, invented the story of his adoption by the Marchese Tassi. When still young he left Rome for Tuscany where he was employed by the Medici perhaps briefly in Florence and for many years in Livorno. In all likelihood his long stay there, interrupted by visits to Rome in 1599 and to Genoa in 1606, was at least in part dictated by punishment for a crime. Little is known of his artistic formation, which probably included contact with Paul Bril and Giulio Parigi. Tassi returned to Rome in late 1610. There, under the direction of Cigoli, he executed a frieze of landscapes and seascapes in Palazzo Firenze (lost). Frescoes in the Palazzo del Quirinale (1611-12), also lost, established Tassi's reputation as Rome's foremost painter of illusionistic architectural decoration. These were commissioned by Pope Paul V and produced with Orazio Gentileschi, who was responsible for the figures. The two also painted frescoes for Cardinal Scipione Borghese in the Casino delle Muse. In 1616-17 Tassi again painted in the Palazzo del Quirinale, with Giovanni Lanfranco and Carlo Saraceni, in the Sala Regia. In 1621 Tassi collaborated with Guercino in the Casino of the Villa Ludovisi, where he created the illusion of tremendous height in relatively low-vaulted spaces. From 1617 to 1625 or later he was engaged in the decoration of several rooms in the Palazzo Lancelotti, which included an elaborate illusionistic architectural setting for the salone and smaller landscapes with scenes from Torquato Tasso's epic poem Gerusalemme Liberata for one of the rooms on the ground floor. In his later career he seems to have abandoned illusionistic architecture in favour of landscape. His last known project is the frieze of Moses in Palazzo Pamphilj in Piazza Navona, painted with Angelo Caroselli and Francesco Lauri, elder brother of Filippo. Although Tassi was better known as a fresco painter he also executed canvases, which range from the small Arrival of the Queen of Sheba before Solomon (c. 1610, Burghley House, Lincolnshire) to the huge Entry of Taddeo Barberini from the Porta del Popolo (1632, Banca di Roma, Rome). Furthermore he is remembered as the master of Claude Lorrain and for having been convicted in 1612 of the rape of Artemisia Gentileschi, the daughter of his partner Orazio. "

34054,Thomas Couture,1815,1879,"French historical and portrait painter, a pupil of Gros and Delaroche. He is chiefly remembered for his vast 'orgy' picture The Romans of the Decadence (Musée du Louvre, Paris), which was the sensation of the Salon of 1847. As with other 'one-picture painters', his reputation has sunk with that of his big work, which now is often cited as the classic example of the worst type of bombastic academic painting, impeccable in every detail and totally false in overall effect. His more informal works, however, are often much livelier in conception and technique, and as a teacher he encouraged direct study from landscape. Manet was his best-known pupil, and others included Puvis de Chavannes and Fantin-Latour. "

54182,Alfred Dedreux,1810,1860,"Alfred Dedreux (also spelt Alfred de Dreux), French painter and draughtsman. His father was the architect Pierre-Anne Dedreux (1788-1849); Alfred's sister, Louise-Marie Becq de Fouquières (1825-92), was also an artist. His uncle, Pierre-Joseph Dedreux-Dorcy (1789-1874), a painter and intimate friend of Géricault, took Dedreux frequently to the atelier of Géricault whose choice of subjects, especially horses, had a lasting influence on him. During the 1820s he studied with Léon Cogniet (1794-1880), although his early style was more influenced by the work of Stubbs, Morland, Constable and Landseer, exposure to which probably came through Géricault and the painter Eugène Lami who lived in London in the mid-1820s. Following the Revolution in 1848, the French royal family emigrated to England where Dedreux frequently visited them, painting many equestrian portraits of the exiled King Louis-Philippe and his sons. He returned to Grance and was commissioned to paint a portrait of Napoleon III in 1859 (Musée de l'Armée, Paris). A dispute arose over his equestrian portrait and in March 1860 he was killed in a duel by Comte Fleury, Napoleon's principal aide-de-camp. "

42406,Francisco de Zurbarán,1598,1664,"Spanish painter of saints and churchmen. His use of sharply defined, often brilliant, colors, minute detail in simple compositions, strongly three-dimensional modeling of figures, and the shadowed light that brightly illuminates his subjects all give his paintings a solidity and dignity evocative of the solitude and solemnity of monastic life. His work at its best fuses two dominant tendencies in Spanish art, realism and mysticism. Zurbarán was born of Basque ancestry in Fuente de Cantos, Badajoz Province, on November 7, 1598. He was apprenticed to a minor Spanish painter in Seville but appears to have been influenced early in his career by Michelangelo. In 1617 he went to work in Llerena, and in 1629, at the invitation of the town council, he settled in Seville. Zurbarán spent the next 30 years there, with the exception of two years (1634-35) that he spent in Madrid working for the royal court. Zurbarán left Seville in 1658, after his reputation declined there; he died in Madrid on August 27, 1664. Zurbarán was only slightly influenced by Diego Rodriguez Velázquez and Jusepe de Ribera. Late in his career, however, he changed his style, according to some critics, for the worse, after being influenced by Bartolomé Estéban Murillo. Zurbarán's earliest known work, painted when he was 18 years old, is Immaculate Conception (private collection, Bilbao). Other notable early works include Crucifixion (1627-29, Museum of Fine Arts, Seville); several large scenes of the life of St Peter Nolasco (died 1256), the founder of the Mercedarians, originally done for a convent in Seville (1628-29); The Apotheosis of St. Thomas Aquinas (1631, Museum of Fine Arts, Seville); and Still Life with Oranges (1633, Norton Simon Museum, Pasadena).

34146,Gerard David,1450,1523,"Flemish painter who was the last great master of the Bruges school. David went to Bruges, presumably from Haarlem, where he is supposed to have formed his early style under the instruction of Albert van Ouwater; he joined the guild of St Luke at Bruges in 1484 and became dean in 1501. In his early work, such as the Christ Nailed to the Cross (National Gallery, London) and the Nativity (Museum of Fine Arts, Budapest), he followed the Haarlem tradition as represented by Ouwater and Geertgen tot Sint Jans but already gave evidence of his superior power as a colourist. In Bruges he studied masterpieces by the van Eycks, Rogier van der Weyden, and Hugo van der Goes and came under the influence of Hans Memling. To this period belong the Marriage at Cana (c. 1500; Louvre, Paris) and the Enthroned Madonna with Angels (Darmstadt). But the works on which David's fame rests most securely are his great altarpieces - the Judgment of Cambyses (two panels, 1498) and the triptych of the Baptism of Christ (c. 1502-07) at Bruges; the Virgin and Child with Saints and Donor (c. 1505; National Gallery, London); the Annunciation on two panels (Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York); and, above all, the documented altarpiece of the Madonna with Angels and Saints (1509, Musée des Beaux-Arts, Rouen). These are mature works - severe yet richly coloured, showing a masterful handling of light, volume, and space. The Judgment panels are especially notable for being among the earliest Flemish paintings to employ such Italian Renaissance devices as putti and garlands. In Antwerp David became impressed by the life and movement in the work of Quentin Massys, who had introduced a more intimate and more human conception of sacred themes. David's Lamentation (c. 1515; National Gallery, London) and the Crucifixion (1510-15; Genoa) were painted under this influence and are remarkable for their dramatic movement. Authorities disagree about the intent of David's eclectic, deliberately archaic manner. Some feel that he drew on earlier masters in an effort, doomed by lack of imagination, to revive the fading art of Bruges. Others see David as a progressive artist who sought to base his innovations on the achievements of the founders of the Netherlandish school. "

41524,Johann Friedrich August Tischbein,1750,1812,"German painter, part of a family of artists from Hesse which between the early 18th century and the late 19th produced 28 artists and artisans, a third of them women, who were active throughout Germany and elsewhere in Europe. The family's three most famous members are known as 'der Kasseler' (Johann Heinrich Tischbein I), 'der Leipziger'(Johann Friedrich August Tischbein) and 'der Neapolitaner' or 'Goethe Tischbein' (Johann Heinrich Wilhelm Tischbein). Johann Friedrich August Tischbein (der Leipziger) was the nephew of Johann Heinrich Tischbein I. After initial study with his father, Johann Valentin Tischbein, and with his uncle, he studied in Paris (1772-77) with support from a patron, Graf Friedrich von Waldeck. He stayed in Rome from 1777 to 1779, where he was influenced by Anton Raphael Mengs and Heinrich Füger. In 1780 he became court painter to von Waldeck at Schloss Arolsen near Kassel. By the late 1780s he had abandoned his early Rococo style and had adopted a sentimental form of Neo-classicism and a sensitive, proto-Romantic naturalism based on the work of such painters as George Romney, Gainsborough and Elisabeth Vigée-Lebrun. His portrait of Herr von Chatelain (1791; Munich, Neue Pinakothek), which helped establish his lasting reputation as a portrait painter, attests to his eclectic approach. The young man's leisurely pose, dreamy expression and fashionable dress, and the outdoor setting reveal, moreover, the shift in social values from the dominance of the aristocracy to bourgeois society, with its greater concern with psychological characterization. Friedrich Tischbein established himself as a portrait painter in Leipzig; he was a much sought after, fashionable portrait painter. From 1786 on, he frequently travelled to the Netherlands to carry out commissions. "

41877,Juan Ribalta,1596,1628,"Spanish painter, son of Francisco Ribalta. He trained in his father's workshop and followed his style closely, though his manner is freer and more vigorous. Juan's early talent is evident in the large Christ Nailed to the Cross (1615; Valencia, Museo de Bellas Artes) painted for S Miguel de los Reyes, Valencia, in which the figures of the rough executioners are taken from an Italian copy (Valencia, Colegio de Corpus Christi) of Caravaggio's Martyrdom of St Peter (1601; Rome, Santa Maria del Popolo). Juan's indirect knowledge of the Escorial painters came through his father, and he was influenced by engravings of Albrecht Dürer, but his fundamental tendency was towards naturalism. The presence of Pedro Orrente in Valencia in 1616 brought changes in Juan's style; he used warmer colours, with underpainting in red ochre, as well as more descriptive detail. This is apparent in Adoration of the Shepherds (1616; Torrente, Valencia, Parroquia de la Asunción). "

41898,Giovanni Jacopo Caraglio,1490,1570,"Italian engraver and designer, known also as Jacobus Parmensis or Jacobus Veronensis. He was a pupil of Marcantonio Raimondi in Rome and achieved distinction as an engraver on copper and, later, as a designer of medals and engraver of gems. In Rome, the printer and publisher Baviera introduced him to Rosso Fiorentino, whose allegory Fury he engraved. Caraglio continued to collaborate with Rosso and engraved several suites, two after Rosso and eighteen after Perino del Vaga. After the Sack of Rome (1527), Caraglio took refuge in Venice, where he made engravings after Titian. His presence is recorded there until 1537. By 1539 he was in Poland, probably at the recommendation of his friend Pietro Aretino, who had contacts in the court of Bona Sforza (1494-1557), wife of Sigismund I, King of Poland. By 1545 Caraglio entered the service of the King as goldsmith, medallist and engraver of hardstones. In the latter part of his life he returned to Italy, and after working for a time at Verona, settled on his own estate near Parma, which he sometimes inscribed on his plates. His plates, about 70 in number, are chiefly reproductions of works of the Italian masters - Raphael, Titian, Michelangelo, and others. "

He spent his early years as a painter at Nuremberg but had returned before 1780 to Rome, where he was elected a member of the Congregazione dei Virtuosi del Pantheon. In 1786 he became a member of the Accademia di San Luca. He painted portraits, genre scenes and altarpieces but was best known for his landscapes, which are in the style of Claude, though with the characteristically lighter colours of the 18th century. In the 1780s he was particularly popular with British Grand Tourists in Rome. In 1789 Sir Richard Colt Hoare (1758-1838), for whom he made souvenir drawings and watercolours, invited Labruzzi to accompany him along the Appian Way, following the itinerary outlined by the Roman poet Horace in his description of a journey made to Brindisi in 38 BC. Labruzzi was to make drawings of the remains of the ancient tombs and villas along their route. In the event the enterprise was cut short by inclement weather and Labruzzi's ill health, but 226 pen-and-wash drawings were completed and bound into 5 volumes by Colt Hoare. A second set of drawings, which are less highly finished and perhaps served as preparatory studies, were kept by Labruzzi. Labruzzi did not provide a purely topographical record of the Classical remains but represented the overgrown ruins in a picturesque and idealized manner. Publication of the drawings was begun by Labruzzi, who engraved 24 of the plates himself. There are various drawings by Labruzzi in Rome (Vatican, Biblioteca Apostolica) and London (British Museum). The publishers Franenholz of Nuremberg and dell'Armi of Rome engaged Labruzzi to make copies of the frescoes then attributed to Masaccio in the basilica of San Clemente in Rome (now given to Masolino). He executed classicized linear illustrations of the main compositions of the Life of St Catherine cycle and detailed studies of the heads and hands in subtly modulated cross-hatching. In 1814 Labruzzi was appointed director of the Accademia di Belle Arti in Perugia, a position he held for three years until his death. "

Grimaldi first studied in Bologna in the circle of the Carracci. Around 1626 he went to Rome; by 1635, he was a member of the Accademia di San Luca and associated with the artists working with Pietro da Cortona. In Rome, Grimaldi regularly collaborated on public decorations with other artists, including Alessandro Algardi and Gaspard Dughet. Although he spent most of his career in Rome, Grimaldi did work elsewhere. From 1649 to 1651, he worked with Giovanni Francesco Romanelli in Paris, both in the palace of Cardinal Mazarin (now the Bibliothèque Nationale) and in the Palais du Louvre. Between 1656 and 1659, he was probably designing the chapel of the Immaculate Conception in Tivoli Cathedral. An accomplished fresco painter, Grimaldi painted a variety of subjects, but his decorative landscapes were most popular with leading Roman families. Organized around a clear sequence of planes leading into the distance punctuated by people and buildings, Grimaldi's landscape drawings remained based in the Carracci tradition. His many etchings and drawings spread the influence of the Bolognese landscape throughout Europe. "

41318,Adriaen van der Werff,1659,1722,"Dutch painter of religious and mythological scenes and portraits, active mainly in Rotterdam. At the age of ten he started to take lessons, two years later moving in with Eglon van der Neer, specializing in clothes and draperie. At the age of seventeen he founded his own studio in Rotterdam where he later became the head of guild of Saint Luke. In 1696 he was paid a visit by Johann Wilhelm, Elector Palatine and his wife Anna Maria Luisa de' Medici. The couple ordered two paintings to be send to Cosimo III de' Medici in Florence. During the next years Van der Werff traveled regularly between Düsseldorf and his home town. In 1703 he became the official court painter and a knight, when his former teacher and predecessor Van der Neer died. Van der Werff, with a perfect technique, was paid extremely well by the Elector for his biblical or classical (erotic) paintings. In 1705 he painted a portrait of Gian Gastone de' Medici. In 1716 he lost his job when the Elector died, because the treasury was empty. He combined the precise finish of the Leiden tradition (learned from his master Eglon van der Neer) with the classical standards of the French Academy and became the most famous Dutch painter of his day, winning international success and earning an enormous fortune. Houbraken, writing in 1721, considered him the greatest of all Dutch painters and this was the general critical opinion for about another century. He is now considered an extremely accomplished, rather sentimental and repetitive minor master. Van der Werff also worked as an architect in Rotterdam, designing elegant house façades. His brother, Pieter van der Werff, was his principal pupil and assistant, imitating Adriaen's style closely and making many copies of his work."

He was born into a family of artists in Toulon: his grandfather Jean (c. 1660-1721) was a decorator of naval vessels and painter of religious works; his father, Jacques Volaire (1685-1768), was official painter of Toulon between 1729 and 1766 and in 1745 was commissioned to paint a large Glory of the Holy Sacrament (Toulon Cathedral); his uncle François-Alexis (1699-1775) was also a painter, and his cousin Marie-Anne (1730-1806) was a portrait painter. In 1755 Volaire is documented (as 'le fils') working on the restoration of paintings in Toulon Cathedral. In September 1754 Joseph Vernet arrived in Toulon. He was painting a series of topographical views of the major French seaports for Louis XV. Almost certainly Vernet took on Volaire as an assistant in 1754 or 1755, although this is not documented until 1759. Volaire's role in the series of ports is unknown; it may have been merely mechanical, but he could have provided expert knowledge of the military port of Toulon and French naval life. From his master Volaire learned a sharp sense of observation, a lively technique and care in the design and lighting of a painting. He was Vernet's most inventive follower, not content to copy his master's well-tried formulae but prepared to adapt to new aesthetic criteria. In 1769 Volaire left Rome for Naples, where night scenes became his specialty, showing silhouetted figures against vivid contrasts of cool moonlight and warm fires. He painted several scenes representing the eruptions of Vesuvius since there were a number of eruptions during his sojourn in Naples. "

62497,George Minne,1866,1941,"Belgian sculptor. He is known for his idealized depictions of man's inner spiritual conflicts, including the ""Kneeling Youth"" sculpture series. A contemporary of Gustav Klimt and Egon Schiele, Minne's work shows many similarities in both form and subject matter to the Viennese Secessionists. In his late 1800s work, George Minne captured a sense of spiritual unease strikingly contemporary in its outlook. The attenuated proportions, softly modelled flesh, and unstable posture of his simple, mystical figures, express anxiety and resignation. At the Ghent Academy, Minne studied architecture before taking courses in sculpture and painting. Around 1887, when Minne began exhibiting, Symbolist writers like Maurice Maeterlinck recognized the power of his grieving, injured figures; and invited him to illustrate their literary works, which also de-emphasized naturalism in favour of exploring the human spiritual life and inner conflict. Auguste Rodin's work was a point of departure for Minne. But about 1891, after Rodin had patronizingly dismissed him with words of encouragement, Minne returned to Belgium. He worked for his architect father, married, and soon went bankrupt. Then, in 1896, having spent a year at the academy in Brussels, his most productive time began. Mostly small in scale, Minne'swork contains only a few motifs that he explored repeatedly. Best known is Kneeling Youth, which displays influence from Gothic sculpture and the Pre-Raphaelites. His major success throughout Europe began around 1900 but, ironically, by that time, he had already created his most important sculptures. Minne strongly influenced artists in Belgium, France, and Germany. "

16502,Masaccio,1401,1438,"Masaccio (1401-1427?), the first great painter of the Italian Renaissance, whose innovations in the use of scientific perspective inaugurated the modern era in painting. Masaccio, originally named Tommaso Cassai, was born in San Giovanni Valdarno, near Florence, on December 21, 1401. He joined the painters guild in Florence in 1422. His remarkably individual style owed little to other painters, except possibly the great 14th-century master Giotto. He was more strongly influenced by the architect Brunelleschi and the sculptor Donatello, both of whom were his contemporaries in Florence. From Brunelleschi he acquired a knowledge of mathematical proportion that was crucial to his revival of the principles of scientific perspective. From Donatello he imbibed a knowledge of classical art that led him away from the prevailing Gothic style. He inaugurated a new naturalistic approach to painting that was concerned less with details and ornamentation than with simplicity and unity, less with flat surfaces than with the illusion of three dimensionality. Together with Brunelleschi and Donatello, he was a founder of the Renaissance. Only four unquestionably attributable works of Masaccio survive, although various other paintings have been attributed in whole or in part to him. All of his works are religious in nature-altarpieces or church frescoes. The earliest, a panel, the Madonna with St. Anne (circa 1423, Uffizi, Florence), shows the influence of Donatello in its realistic flesh textures and solidly rounded forms. The fresco Trinity (c. 1425, Santa Maria Novella, Florence) used full perspective for the first time in Western art. His altarpiece for Santa Maria del Carmine, Pisa (1426), with its central panel of the Adoration of the Magi (now in the Staatliche Museen, Berlin), was a simple, unadorned version of a theme that was treated by other painters in a more decorative, ornamental manner. The fresco series for the Brancacci Chapel in Santa Maria del Carmine, Florence (about 1427) illustrates another of his great innovations, the use of light to define the human body and its draperies. In these frescoes, rather than bathing his scenes in flat uniform light, he painted them as if they were illuminated from a single source of light (the actual chapel window), thus creating a play of light and shadow (chiaroscuro) that gave them a natural, realistic quality unknown in the art of his day. Of these six fresco scenes, Tribute Money and the Expulsion from Paradise are considered his masterpieces. Masaccio's work exerted a strong influence on the course of later Florentine art and particularly on the work of Michelangelo. He died in Rome in 1427 or 1428. "

34023,John Constable,1776,1837,"English painter, ranked with Turner as one of the greatest British landscape artists. Although he showed an early talent for art and began painting his native Suffolk scenery before he left school, his great originality matured slowly. He committed himself to a career as an artist only in 1799, when he joined the Royal Academy Schools, and it was not until 1829 that he was grudgingly made a full Academician, elected by a majority of only one vote. In 1816 he became financially secure on the death of his father and married Maria Bicknell after a seven-year courtship and in the face of strong opposition from her family. During the 1820s he began to win recognition: The Hay Wain (National Gallery, London, 1821) won a gold medal at the Paris Salon of 1824 and Constable was admired by Delacroix and Bonington among others. His wife died in 1828, however, and the remaining years of his life were clouded by despondency. After spending some years working in the Picturesque tradition of landscape and the manner of Gainsborough. Constable developed his own original treatment from the attempt to render scenery more directly and realistically, carrying on but modifying in an individual way the tradition inherited from Ruisdael and the Dutch 17th-century landscape painters. Just as his contemporary William Wordsworth rejected what he called the 'poetic diction' of his predecessors, so Constable turned away from the pictorial conventions of 18th-century landscape painters, who, he said, were always 'running after pictures and seeking the truth at second hand'. Constable thought that 'No two days are alike, nor even two hours; neither were there ever two leaves of a tree alike since the creation of the world', and in a way that was then new he represented in paint the atmospheric effects of changing light in the open air, the movement of clouds across the sky, and his excited delight at these phenomena, stemming from a profound love of the country: 'The sound of water escaping from mill dams, willows, old rotten planks, slimy posts and brickwork. I love such things. These scenes made me a painter.' He never went abroad, and his finest works are of the places he knew and loved best, particularly Suffolk and Hampstead, where he lived from 1821. To render the shifting flicker of light and weather he abandoned fine traditional finish, catching the sunlight in blobs of pure white or yellow, and the drama of storms with a rapid brush. Constable worked extensively in the open air, drawing and sketching in oils, but his finished pictures were produced in the studio. For his most ambitious works - 'sixfooters' as he called them - he followed the unusual technical procedure of making a full-size oil sketch, and in the 20th century there has been a tendency to praise these even more highly than the finished works because of their freedom and freshness of brushwork. (The full-size sketch for The Hay Wain is in the Victoria and Albert Museum, London, which has the finest collection of Constable's work.) In England Constable had no real successor and the many imitators (who included his son Lionel, 1825-87) turned rather to the formal compositions than to the more direct sketches. In France, however, he was a major influence on Romantic painters such as Delacroix, on the members of the Barbizon School, and ultimately on the Impressionists. "

2117,Giulio Benso,1601,1668,"Italian painter and draughtsman. Around 1605 he came to Genoa, where he presented himself to a leading patron of the arts, Gian Carlo Doria, who gave him lodging and recommended him to Giovanni Battista Paggi (1554-1627), in whose influential studio he trained. Students were required first to copy sketches, then paintings and reliefs and, finally, to draw from nature. Benso made many copies after a variety of source material, among them the Sacrifice of Abraham (Florence, Uffizi) after Luca Cambiaso and the Joseph Sold into Slavery (Berlin, Kupferstichkabinett) after Raphael. While still with Paggi, Benso produced 'bizarre sketches of great number and variety, as he had a fertile mind along with a lively and vigorous imagination'. In order to learn perspective he constructed architectural models, which were greatly admired; they enabled him to achieve formidable feats of aerial perspective in his paintings, in which figures and ornament are boldly foreshortened. Apart from his work in Liguria, he decorated the Palazzo Grimaldi in Cagnes-sur-Mer with the Fall of Phaethon and sent works to the Abbey of Weingarten in Germany. In the 1630s, he completed his masterpiece, a fresco in the presbytery and apse of the church of the Basilica della Santissima Annunziata del Vastato. There are also paintings of his in his hometown of Pieve di Teco as well as in the parish church of Sant'Ambrogio in Alassio. "

Although he is known to have painted religious works on commission, Juan de Zurbarán seems to have specialized in still-lifes, for his only certain works are in this genre. Socially he was somewhat pretentious, partial to such courtly pastimes as the dance, and using the aristocratic 'Don' when signing his name. In 1644 he married Mariana de Quadros, daughter of a wealthy money-lender. "

His richly eclective style was formed mainly in Italy, where he worked c. 1616-1622, and his openness to very diverse influences was later fuelled by his activities as a picture dealer. Paradoxically, in view of his varied sources of inspiration, his style is the most distinctive of any French painter of his generation - highly coloured and often bizarrely expressive. Elsheimer and the Caravaggisti were strong influences on his handling of light, and his richly encrusted brushwork has striking affinities with Rembrandt, whose work he is known to have sold. Vignon is said to have fathered more than twenty children by his two wives, and his sons Claude the Younger (1633-1703) and Philippe, as well as her daughter Charlotte were also painters."

115901,Galileo Chini,1873,1956,"Italian painter and potter. He began his artistic activity at a very early age as a decorator and fresco painter. Initially, Chini was influenced by the Pre-Raphaelites and Art Nouveau, but by the early 1900s, he was working in a wholly Symbolist idiom. He participated in international exhibitions both with paintings and ceramics, which he had begun making in 1896. His work as a potter was highly innovative and receptive to outside influences, especially from England and Central Europe; he developed a brilliant and personal style, characterized above all by the results he obtained with lustre glaze on stoneware. Chini's interior fresco schemes for the Cassa di Risparmio in Pistoia (1904) and other designs in the following years earned him a commission for the Palace of the Throne in Bangkok, on which he worked from 1911 to 1914. During his years there, he developed a refined but free and sensual Divisionist style that captured the transient nature of the senses and light as it falls on objects. After his return to Italy, Chini continued painting large decorative schemes, with much success, until the end of the 1920s. These included the Terme Berzieri in Salsomaggiore (1922-29). During the 1930s and 1940s, he produced numerous easel paintings characterized by an elegance of composition and intensity of colour, close to the manner of Bonnard. "

34465,Giovanni Antonio Fasolo,1530,1572,"Italian painter. Of Lombard origin, he was initially a pupil of Paolo Veronese and subsequently had a short but successful career as a fresco and portrait painter in and around Vicenza. In 1551-52 he collaborated with Gian Battista Zelotti and Veronese on frescoes for the Castello Porto-Colleoni, Thiene. Scenes such as the Meeting of Sophonisba and Massinissa are executed in the style of Veronese, but with a noticeably harder and drier edge and lacking Veronese's rich luminosity and effortless control of space. In 1555-56 Fasolo was employed as a minor assistant to Veronese at San Sebastiano, Venice, but emerged in his own right towards the end of the decade (1557-61), when he began producing stage designs for the Accademia Olimpica, Vicenza. In the 1560s he executed frescoes at several country villas: at the Villa Roberto (Brugine, nr Padua; c. 1564-65), the Villa Campiglia (Albettone, nr Vicenza; c. 1565-67) and the Villa Caldogno (Caldogno, nr Vicenza; c. 1568-70). These last (e.g. the Stolen Embrace) are characterized by their contemporary air and informality, reproducing on a large scale the naturalistic tendencies - a possible Lombard inheritance - that underpin his style and become increasingly apparent in his portraiture.

The second son of Louis Parrocel (1634-1694) and grandson of Barthélemy Parrocel (1595-1660), Pierre Parrocel first studied with his uncle Joseph before going to Rome to work in the studio of Carlo Maratti. Returning to France, he moved about between Languedoc, Provence and the Venaissin, leaving evidence of his talent in all these places. He was married for the first time in Avignon in 1690 to Marie Anne de Seisson. His second wife, whom he married in 1695, was Marie Magdeleine de Pallas by whom he had eight children. Two of them, Pierre Ignace (1702-1775) and Joseph François (1704-1781), were to be artists. Pierre was recognised by the Académie Royale as a history painter in 1730 but never became a member. Of all the Parrocels, Pierre was the one to produce the largest number of works in the south of France, thus exercising a considerable influence on the development of southern French painting. He painted 16 pictures for the gallery of the Hôtel de Noailles in St-Germain-en-Laye depicting the story of Tobias. Engraved several times, these paintings were sold in 1770 to Borély. "

40724,Lelio Orsi,1508,1587,"Italian painter and draughtsman. A prominent Emilian artist of the mid-16th century, he was influenced by Correggio as well as by the late Mannerist style of Giulio Romano. His large-scale works seem to have been mainly secular decorations, notably illusionistic façades, of which only fragments are extant. Their energy and expressiveness are apparent, however, in the surviving paintings of smaller dimensions. Orsi's sole documented architectural work is the Collegiata di S Stefano, Novellara (1567; study, Windsor Castle, Royal Library). Lelio Orsi studied with his painter father, but very early on he incorporated into his polished, illusionistic style the two influences that remained primary throughout his life: Giulio Romano's exaggerated movement and excitability and Correggio's poignant passion and vibrant way of seeing. By 1538 Orsi had moved to a larger nearby town, Reggio Emilia, where he painted many architectural façades with illusionistic designs. Accused of involvement in a murder, he returned to his native Novellara in 1546, where he continued to create distinguished decorative works, especially as a painter of façades for the local nobility. Though he also completed a large project for the count of Novellara, providing everything from architectural drawings to decorative partitions for a villa, only fragments of any of these works survive. The year 1554, spent in Rome, was decisive: there he absorbed Michelangelo's Mannerism, which stayed with him for life. He began to concentrate on making easel paintings of mostly mythological and religious subjects; they indicated the energy and expressiveness of his monumental works, and their jeweled technique made them beautiful in themselves. By 1576 Orsi was probably back in Reggio Emilia. "

36264,Stefano Pozzi,1699,1768,"Italian painter and draughtsman. His father, Giovanni Pozzi (1672-1752), arrived in Rome c. 1690 as an innkeeper and became a renowned ivory carver. He had four sons, all artists: Rocco (1701-1774), an engraver; Andrea (1718-1769), an ivory carver; Giuseppe (1723-1765), a painter, and Stefano, the eldest, who became a pupil of the two best followers of Carlo Maratti: Andrea Procaccini until he left for Spain in 1720, then Agostino Masucci. In 1732 Stefano was admitted to the Congregazione dei Virtuosi al Pantheon (of which he was Reggente in 1739) and in 1736 to the Accademia di San Luca. He worked primarily for churches, painting, for example, eight ovals (c. 1736) for San Silvestro al Quirinale, Rome (in situ), and the Death of St Joseph (1742; in situ) for San Nome di Maria, Rome. In 1744 he was summoned to Naples by Cardinal Spinelli to decorate the apse of the cathedral restored by Paolo Posi; for the right wall he painted the large oil of SS Januarius and Agrippino Driving out the Saracens (in situ) and on the vault a fresco of a Choir of Angels (in situ). In subsequent commissions he was linked with the architect Luigi Vanvitelli: in 1744 he produced two paintings for the Montemorcino monastery that Vanvitelli had just built for the Olivetans at Perugia (now the Palazzo dell' Università): an Annunciation (in situ) and the Blessed Bernardino Tolomei among the Plague-stricken (Rome, Santa Francesca Romana). For the library that Vanvitelli designed for the Palazzo Sciarra-Colonna in Rome, he painted Allegories of the Signs of the Zodiac (in situ). "
34259,Christian Wilhelm Ernst Dietrich,1712,1774,"German painter and etcher. He received his first training from his father, Johann Georg Dietrich (1684-1752), a court painter at Weimar, and was sent to Dresden at the age of 13 to study under the landscape painter Johann Alexander Thiele. In 1728 they travelled to Arnstadt to paint landscapes for stage sets. In 1730 Thiele presented his pupil to Frederick-Augustus I, Elector of Saxony, as a prodigy; Frederick-Augustus appointed him court painter and entrusted him to his minister Heinrich, Graf von Brühl, for whom he worked on some decorative paintings. From 1732 he used the name 'Dietricy' to sign his paintings. He travelled in Germany from 1734 and may have visited the Netherlands, the source of his artistic inspiration. He returned from his travels in 1741 and was appointed court painter to Frederick-Augustus II, Elector of Saxony, who sent him to Italy in 1743 to study. He visited Venice and Rome but returned to Dresden in 1744. In 1748 he was appointed Inspector of the Gemäldegalerie in Dresden, which had recently become more influential because of important purchases from Italy. The following period saw Dietrich at the height of his success, and his works were in demand all over Europe. "

108299,Orazio Mochi,1571,1625,"Italian sculptor. He was long thought to have been the father of Francesco Mochi. This misconception lingers, even in many modern publications, and is doubtless due to the fact that he did indeed have a sculptor son called Francesco Mochi (1603-1649), but - like his brother Stefano Mochi - he was a minor figure, and his work is virtually unknown. Mochi trained in the early 1590s with the Mannerist sculptor Giovanni Battista Caccini and later in that decade collaborated with him in Pisa on a set of bronze doors for the Porta Regia of the cathedral. Mochi's contribution included the large bronze panel of the Incarnation of the Virgin (c. 1598-99) and portions of the decorative frieze. After 1604 he worked in Florence, modelling small decorative sculptures in the grand-ducal workshop, the Opificio delle Pietre Dure. His best-known pieces are the exquisite inlaid stone relief of Grand Duke Cosimo II de' Medici Praying (c. 1610; Palazzo Pitti, Florence) and the small witty bronze of Saccomazzone Players (c. 1621), which the sculptor Romolo Ferrucci (c. 1550-1621) later enlarged to life-size for the Boboli Gardens. Mochi's works typically blend hints of Baroque naturalism with a Mannerist precocity that well suited the tastes of his patron. Like many of his contemporaries, he worked in a style that hovered between the late Mannerism of his teacher Caccini and the early Baroque brio of Francesco Mochi. "

40773,Jusepe de Ribera,1591,1652,"José (or Jusepe) de Ribera, Spanish painter, etcher, and draughtsman, active for all his known career in Italy, where he was called 'Lo Spagnoletto' (the Little Spaniard). Little is known of his life before he settled in Naples (at the time a Spanish possession) in 1616. Naples was then one of the main centres of the Caravaggesque style, and Ribera is often described as one of Caravaggio's followers. However, although his early work is markedly tenebrist, it is much more individual than that of most Caravaggesque artists, particularly in his vigorous and scratchy handling of paint. Similarly, his penchant for the typically Caravaggesque theme of bloody martyrdom has been overplayed, enshrined as it is in Byron's lines: 'Spagnoletto tainted/His brush with all the blood of all the sainted' (Don Juan, xiii. 71). He undoubtedly painted some powerful pictures of this type, notably the celebrated Martyrdom of St Bartholomew (Prado, Madrid, c. 1630), but he was equally capable of great tenderness, as in The Adoration of the Shepherds (Louvre, Paris, 1650), and his work is remarkable for his feeling for individual humanity. Indeed, he laid the foundation of that respect for the dignity of the individual which was so important a feature of Spanish art from Velázquez to Goya. This feature of his work is evident also in the secular subjects, such as The Clubfooted Boy (Louvre, 1642). He was the first to breach the traditional Spanish dislike for mythological themes (Apollo and Marsyas, Musées Royaux, Brussels, 1637), and he broadened the Baroque repertory by his series of philosophers depicted as beggars or vagabonds (Archimedes, Prado, 1630). Ribera gradually moved away from his early tenebrist style, and his late works are often rich in colour and soft in modelling. He was the leading painter in Naples in his period (Velázquez visited him during his second visit to Italy and probably during his first) and his work was influential in Spain (where much of it was exported) as well as in Italy. His reputation has remained high, and until the Napoleonic Wars he and Murillo were virtually the only Spanish painters who were widely known outside their native country. "
35673,Maxime Maufra,1861,1918,"French painter and printmaker. He began painting under the guidance of local painters in Nantes such as the brothers Charles Leduc (b. 1831) and Alfred Leduc (c. 1850-1913) and the landscape painter Charles Le Roux (1841-1895). Having originally intended to go into business, he turned to painting after a visit in 1883 to Britain, where he first saw the work of Turner. Back in Nantes he was encouraged to take up art by Charles Le Roux, who initiated him into the techniques of the Impressionists. He exhibited for the first time in 1886 at Nantes and in the Paris Salon with critical approval. After the successful exhibition he decided to devote himself full time to his painting. He admired Monet and Sisley and was influenced by Whistler. He travelled throughout Brittany and met Gauguin at Pont-Aven in 1890. Maufra settled in Paris in 1892 at the Bateau-Lavoir but returned to Brittany each year, in particular to the Quiberon region. In 1894 Le Barc de Boutteville mounted an exhibition of his work which revealed his individual talents to a wider public. He subsequently exhibited with Durand-Ruel, to whom he remained under contract for the rest of his life. His art was enriched by his travels in the Dauphiné (1904), the Midi (1912), Algeria (1913) and Savoy (1914), and also by his exploration of etching and lithography. "
34961,Ferdinand Hodler,1853,1918,"Swiss painter. The oeuvre Ferdinand Hodler, who is held to be one of the foremost Central European Symbolist painters of the late nineteenth century, was shaped by his personal conception of the world, underpinned by the principles of symmetry and rhythm. He came from a poor family and lost both of his parents at an early age. He received his first training from Ferdinand Sommer (1822-1901), a painter from Thun who produced lake and mountain landscape views for tourists. In 1871 or 1872 Hodler moved to Geneva to attend lectures in natural science at the Collège de Genève and to copy paintings by Alexandre Calame and François Diday in the museum there. In 1873 he became a pupil of Barthélemy Menn (1815-1893) at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Geneva and while there undertook an intensive study of Dürer's writings on proportions. In 1878 he travelled to Madrid, spending almost a year there, and was strongly influenced by the Spanish landscape and by the works of such masters as Titian, Poussin, Claude, Velázquez and Goya in the Museo del Prado. He returned to Switzerland in 1879, having learnt to lighten his colour. On returning to Switzerland he was introduced to the Symbolist trends in French painting by the poet Louis Duchosal. Thenceforward his works reinforced this aspect and were centred on representing states of mind and man's main philosophical concerns. Dating from this stage in his development is Night, executed in 1890 (Berne, Kunstmuseum Bern), a painting related to the idea of death and sleep, which enjoyed success at the Salon de la Rose+Croix in Paris in 1892. A subsequent series of twenty-seven life-sized figures from Swiss history, painted from life, marked the start of his career as a painter of the Swiss national imaginary and the beginning of the considerable appreciation he still enjoys in his country of birth. Hodler took part in the Berlin Secession in 1900, in the Munich Secession in 1903, and a year later showed his works together with those of Edvard Munch and Axel Gallén at the Vienna Secession. During the last years of his life he ended up becoming one of the most innovative muralists of the period, with works such as those executed for the University of Jena in 1907 and Hanover council in 1911. He died in Geneva in 1918. "

34598,Ubaldo Gandolfi,1728,1781,"Painter, draughtsman and sculptor, part of an Italian family of artists. The work of the brothers Ubaldo Gandolfi and Gaetano Gandolfi and of the latter's son, Mauro Gandolfi, reflects the transition from late Bolognese Baroque through Neo-classicism and into early Italian Romanticism. During their period of collective productivity, from c. 1760 to c. 1820, the Gandolfi produced paintings, frescoes, drawings, sculptures and prints. Their drawings (examples by all three artists, Venice, Fondazione Cini) made an outstanding contribution to the great figurative tradition of Bolognese draughtsmanship that had begun with the Carracci. Their prolific output and their activity as teachers gave them considerable influence throughout northern Italy, except in Venice. One of Ubaldo's five children, Giovanni Battista Gandolfi (b 1762), trained at the Accademia Clementina, Bologna, but apart from a vault fresco signed and dated 1798 in the church of S Francesco in Bagnacavallo nothing is known of his adult career. A drawing (Paris, Fondacione Custodia) is signed Ubaldo Lorenzo Gandolfi, who may have been another son. Mauro's daughter, Clementina Gandolfi (b 1795), was an artist and amateur musician, and his son by a second marriage, Democrito Gandolfi (b 1796), studied with Antonio Canova but was an unsuccessful sculptor. He delivered a eulogy at Mauro's funeral and sculpted the portrait bust that stands on the tomb of Gaetano and Mauro in the Certosa di Bologna. Ubaldo Gandolfi painted frescoes, altarpieces and mythological scenes. His vast output of drawings, of which there is a representative collection in the Fondazione Cini, Venice, includes compositional drawings of both religious and mythological subjects and studies from the nude model. He is documented as a sculptor, and a few works executed in terracotta are known. He was enrolled by the age of 17 at the Accademia Clementina in Bologna, where he was taught by Ercole Graziani II, Felice Torelli and Ercole Lelli. Lelli is mainly known for the eerily lifelike wax models of dissected cadavers that he made for the Istituto d'Anatomia; the precise knowledge of human anatomy that is so evident in both Ubaldo's and Gaetano's paintings could well be due to his teaching. Between 1745 and 1749 Ubaldo won three medals for figure drawing. In 1749 his name then disappears from the records of the academy until 1759, when he again received a medal for drawing. The lapsed ten years constitute a lacuna in his career, though a few paintings from this period have recently been identified. Possibly he spent some of the time travelling. "

40636,Jan van Huysum,1682,1749,"Dutch painter, with Rachel Ruysch the most distinguished flower painter of his day. He had a European reputation and was much imitated. The light colours he used, the even lighter bakcgrounds, and the openness of his intricate compositions became distinguishing features of 18th century Dutch flower painting. He occasionally painted subjects other than flowers, including a selfportrait in the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford. His father, Justus the Elder, was a flower and landscape painter and he had three painter brothers: Justus the Younger (c. 1684-1707): Michiel (d. 1759); and Jacob (c. 1687-1740 ?), who worked in England and imitated Jan's style. "
28807,John W. Winkler,1890,1979,
35736,Hans Memling,1430,1494,"Hans Memling (also spelled Memlinc), leading Flemish painter of the Bruges school during the period of the city's political and commercial decline. The number of his imitators and followers testified to his popularity throughout Flanders. His last commission, which has been widely copied, is a Crucifixion panel from the Passion Triptych (1491). Memling, born in the region of the Middle Rhine, was apparently first schooled in the art of Cologne and then travelled to the Netherlands (c. 1455-60), where he probably trained in the workshop of the painter Rogier van der Weyden. He settled in Bruges (Brugge) in 1465; there he established a large shop and executed numerous altarpieces and portraits. Indeed, he was very successful in Bruges: it is known that he owned a large stone house and by 1480 was listed among the wealthiest citizens on the city tax accounts. Sometime between 1470 and 1480 Memling married Anna de Valkenaere (died 1487), who bore him three children. A number of Memling's works are signed and dated, and still others allow art historians to place them easily into a chronology on the basis of the patron depicted in them. Otherwise it is very difficult to discern an early, middle, and late style for the artist. His compositions and types, once established, were repeated again and again with few indications of any formal development. His Madonnas gradually become slenderer and more ethereal and self-conscious, and a greater use of Italian motifs such as putti, garlands, and sculptural detail for the settings marks the later works. His portraits, too, appear to develop from a type with a simple neutral background to those enhanced with a loggia or window view of a landscape, but these, too, may have been less a stylistic development than an adaptation of his compositions to suit the tastes of his patrons. A good example of the difficulties of dating encountered by scholars is the triptych of The Virgin and Child with Saints and Donors that Memling executed for Sir John Donne (National Gallery, London), which until recently had been dated very early - around 1468 - because it was believed that the patron commissioned the work while visiting Bruges for the wedding of Charles the Bold (duke of Burgundy) to Margaret of York and that he died the following year (1469) in the Battle of Edgecote. It is now known that Sir John lived until 1503 and that it is probably his daughter Anne (born 1470 or later) who is portrayed as the young girl kneeling with her parents in the central panel, thus indicating that the painting was commissioned about 1475. Memling's art clearly reveals the influence of contemporary Flemish painters. He borrowed, for example, from the compositions of Jan van Eyck, the famed founder of the Bruges school. The influence of Dieric Bouts and Hugo van der Goes can also be discerned in his works - for example, in a number of eye-catching details such as glistening mirrors, tile floors, canopied beds, exotic hangings, and brocaded robes. Above all, Memling's art reveals a thorough knowledge of, and dependence on, compositions and figure types created by Rogier van der Weyden. In Memling's large triptych (a painting in three panels, generally hinged together) of the Adoration of the Magi (Prado, Madrid), one of his earliest works, and in the altarpiece of 1479 for Jan Floreins (Memling-Museum, Brugge), the influence of Rogier's last masterpiece, the Columba Altarpiece (1460-64; Alte Pinakothek, Munich), is especially noticeable. Some scholars believe that Memling himself may have had a hand in the production of this late work while still in Rogier's studio. He also imitated Rogier's compositions in numerous representations of the half-length Madonna with the Child, often including a pendant with the donor's portrait (the Madonna and Martin van Nieuwenhove; Memling-Museum, Brugge). Many devotional diptychs (two-panel paintings) such as this were painted in 15th-century Flanders. They consist of a portrait of the ""donor"" - or patron - in one panel, reverently gazing at the Madonna and Child in the other. Such paintings were for the donor's personal use in his home or travels. Most of Memling's patrons were those associated with religious houses, such as the Hospital of St John in Bruges, and wealthy businessmen, including burghers of Bruges and foreign representatives of the Florentine Medicis and the Hanseatic League (an association of German merchants dealing abroad). For Tommaso Portinari, a Medici agent, and his wife, Memling painted portraits (Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York City) and an unusual altarpiece that depicts more than 22 scenes from the Passion of Christ scattered in miniature in a panoramic landscape encompassing a view of Jerusalem (Galleria Sabauda, Turin). Such an altarpiece, perhaps created for new devotional practices, became very popular at the end of the 15th century. His best known work with extensive narration is the sumptuous Shrine of St Ursula in the Hospital of St John. It was commissioned by two nuns, Jacosa van Dudzeele and Anna van den Moortele, who are portrayed at one end of the composition kneeling before Mary. This reliquary, completed in 1489, is in the form of a diminutive chapel with six painted panels filling the areas along the sides where stained glass would ordinarily be placed. The narrative, which is the story of Ursula and her 11,000 virgins and their trip from Cologne to Rome and back, unfolds with charm and colourful detail but with little drama or emotion. Other patrons of the same hospital commissioned Memling to paint a large altarpiece of St John with the mystical marriage of St Catherine to Christ as the central theme (Memling-Museum, Brugge). Elaborate narratives appear behind the patron saints John the Baptist and John the Evangelist painted on the side panels, while the central piece is an impressive elaboration of the enthroned Madonna between angels and saints (including Catherine) that one finds in innumerable other devotional pieces attributed to Memling. Because Memling's work was so strongly influenced by that of other painters, it often has been harshly dealt with by 20th-century critics. Yet in his own lifetime he was acclaimed. Recording his death, the notary of Bruges described him as ""the most skillful painter in the whole of Christendom."" "

9960,Eva Gonzalès,1849,1883,"French painter. In 1865, she began her professional training and took lessons in drawing from the society portraitist Charles Chaplin. Gonzalès became a pupil of the artist Édouard Manet in 1869. Manet is said to have begun a portrait of her at once which was completed in 1870 and exhibited at The Salon in that year. Like her teacher, Édouard Manet, she never exhibited with the Impressionist painters in their controversial exhibitions in Paris, but she is considered part of the group because of her painting style. She was Manet's only formal student and modeled frequently for several members of the Impressionist school. Until 1872, she was strongly influenced by Manet but later developed her own, more personal style. She married Henri Guérard, brother of the graphic artist Henri Guérard, and used him and her sister Jeanne Gonzalès as the subjects for many of her paintings. Her career was cut short when she died in childbirth at the age of thirty-four, six days after the death of her teacher, Manet. "

35809,Claude Monet,1840,1926,"French painter, founder and leader  of the Impressionist movement in France; indeed the movement's name, Impressionism, is derived from his Impression, Sunrise (1873; Musée Marmottan Monet, Paris). He adhered to its principles throughout his long career and is considered the most consistently representative painter of the school as well as one of the foremost painters of landscape in the history of art. As a youth in Le Havre, Monet was encouraged by the marine painter Boudin to paint in the open air, a practice he never forsook. After two years (1860-62) with the army in Algeria, he went to Paris, over parental objections, to study painting. In Paris, Monet formed lasting friendships with the artists who would become the major impressionists, including Pissarro, Cézanne, Renoir, Sisley, and Bazille. He and several of his friends painted for a time out-of-doors in the Barbizon district. Renoir and Monet began painting outdoors together in the late 1860s, laying the foundations of Impressionism. Monet soon began to concern himself with his lifelong objective: portraying the variations of light and atmosphere brought on by changes of hour and season. Rather than copy in the Louvre, the traditional practice of young artists, Monet learned from his friends, from the landscape itself, and from the works of his older contemporaries Manet, Corot, and Courbet. Monet's representation of light was based on his knowledge of the laws of optics as well as his own observations of his subjects. He often showed natural colour by breaking it down into its different components as a prism does. Eliminating black and gray from his palette, Monet rejected entirely the academic approach to landscape. In 1874, with Pissarro and Edgar Degas, Monet helped organize the Société Anonyme des Artistes, Peintres, Sculpteurs, Graveurs, etc., the formal name of the Impressionists' group. During the 1870s Monet developed his characteristic technique for rendering atmospheric outdoor light, using broken, rhythmic brushwork. In 1874 Sisley, Morisot, and Monet organized the first impressionist group show, which was ferociously maligned by the critics, who coined the term impressionism after Monet's Impression: Sunrise, 1872 (Musée Marmottan Monet, Paris). The show failed financially. However, by 1883 Monet had prospered, and he retired from Paris to his home in Giverny. In his later works Monet allowed his vision of light to dissolve the real structures of his subjects. To do this he chose simple matter, making several series of studies of the same object at different times of day or year: haystacks, the Gare Saint-Lazare (1876-78), poplars (begun 1890), the Thames, the celebrated group of Rouen Cathedral (1892-94), and the last great lyrical series of water lilies (1899, and 1904-25), painted in his own garden at Giverny. In the last decade of his life Monet, nearly blind, painted a group of large water lily murals (Nymphéas) for the Musée de l'Orangerie in Paris. Monet's work is particularly well represented in the Musée du Louvre, Paris, the Musée Marmottan Monet, Paris, the National Gallery, London, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, and the Art Institute of Chicago. It is also included in many famous private collections. "

8520,Prospero Fontana,1512,1597,"Italian painter, part of a family of painters and draughtsmen, active mostly in Bologna and Rome. The majority of his work belongs to the Mannerist tradition which originated in Rome and Florence in the 1520s, but disseminated more widely within Italy following the sack of Rome in 1527. Prospero Fontana was the leading Bolognese exponent of Mannerism. He trained with Innocenzo da Imola, a follower of Raphael, and early in his career assisted the Mannerist painter Perino del Vaga on the decoration of the Palazzo Doria in Genoa. His contact with Mannerist artists continued during his years as an assistant to Giorgio Vasari on projects in Rome and Florence. Despite this exposure to progressive influences, he continued to paint in an essentially conservative style in this period, as in the Transfiguration with Saints (1545; Bologna, S Domenico). From 1548 he moved between Rome and Bologna: in 1550 he executed frescoes of scenes from the Life of Constantine in the Palazzina della Viola, Bologna (in situ); in 1550-51 he supervised the decorations of the Vatican Belvedere, Rome, for Pope Julius III; and in 1551 he executed frescoes of Virtues and Gods in the Palazzo Bocchi, Bologna. Early in 1553 he was again in Rome, where he worked with Taddeo Zuccaro on the decorations (destroyed) of the Villa Giulia. During this final period in Rome he also executed decorations for the loggia of the Palazzo di Firenze (in situ) for Balduino del Monte, brother of Julius III. Around 1560 he worked briefly with Primaticcio at Fontainebleau in France. His first convincing use of a Mannerist style occurs in such works of this period as the Disputation of St Catherine (c. 1560; Bologna, Madonna del Baraccano). He assisted Vasari again in 1563-65 on the decorations of the Palazzo Vecchio in Florence, and in 1565 he was admitted to the Florentine Accademia del Disegno. He followed the Mannerist style of Vasari until he settled in Bologna in the 1570s. There he responded to the appeals of Cardinal Gabriele Paleotti for artists to provide clear and persuasive religious works in keeping with the suggestions of the Council of Trent. The use of descriptive naturalism and convincing expression characterizes his late style, as in St Alessio Distributing Alms (1576; Bologna, S Giacomo Maggiore). His last important public commission dates from the late 1570s, when he contributed decorations for the rebuilt apse of S Pietro, Bologna (in situ). Although he continued to paint in the 1590s, Prospero failed to respond to the reform of Bolognese painting instigated by the Carracci family. His daughter, Lavinia Fontana was also a successful painter. "

The son of an artist, he settled in Italy in 1613, living chiefly in Rome, with periods in Genoa, Venice and Naples. His style shows an individual talent and a profound study of Italian painters, especially Veronese. Vouet soon enjoyed high favour, including the patronage of Pope Urban VIII. In 1627 he was invited back to France, where he became First Painter, a position challenged only once, in 1640-42, when he was brought into an artificial rivalry with Poussin. Vouet taught or collaborated with almost all the painters of the next generation in France, notably Le Brun, Le Sueur and Mignard. His portraits of the court of Louis XIII and most of his large-scale decorative schemes for Parisian houses and country chateaux have been destroyed. "

6302,Adriaen de Vries,1566,1626,"Adriaen de Vries' career epitomizes the internationalism of the late Mannerist period. He was born in The Hague, trained in Italy, and worked mainly in Prague. His is the time-honored tradition of the itinerant artist, working for many of Europe's most discerning royal patrons. Little is known about de Vries until 1581, when he was an assistant in Giambologna's Florentine workshop. There he trained as a bronzeworker and absorbed much of Giambologna's sophisticated Mannerist style. De Vries' association with Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor, whose rare works of art were the greatest collection of the age, began in 1593. He became court sculptor in 1601. Among de Vries' works for the reclusive monarch was a bronze relief representing Rudolf II's 1585 imperial decree that painting should be considered among the liberal arts. The idea that visual artists should be raised above the level of craftsmen developed during the Italian Renaissance, but Rudolf II made it official. After Rudolf II's death in 1612, de Vries continued working for aristocratic clients, creating numerous funerary monuments, life-size sculptures, fountains, and church fonts. In his late style, he worked the bronze to create a soft, sketchy effect. "

His finest canvases, particularly the celebrated Fur Traders Descending the Missouri (Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, 1845), distil visual poetry from the commonplace, but after a trip to study in Düsseldorf in 1856-58 his work lost much of its racy freshness and charm, becoming overlaid with sentimentality.

He gained his nickname l'Orbetto from guiding his father who took to begging after becoming blind ('orbo' in Italian). Recorded in 1597 as a member of Felice Brusasorci's studio, Alessandro worked in an idiom that reflected Veronese painting traditions, completing commissions for local churches after his master's death in 1605. The following year he was appointed to decorate the organ shutters of the Accademia Filharmonica, one of the city's most prestigious institutions, and soon became a member of this cultural élite as successor to Brusasorzi. During these early years he may have travelled to Mantua and Venice. In Rome around 1614, he painted an impressive oval panel as part of the decoration of the Sala Regia in the Palazzo del Quirinale. In 1616 Cardinal Scipione Borghese paid Alessandro for frescoes in the Casino del Barco at the Villa Pinciana (now destroyed) and acquired some works on slate the following year. As a member of the Accademia di San Luca from 1618, Turchi took an active interest in the running of the institution; this culminated in his election as 'principe' in 1637 and his affiliation to the Virtuosi del Pantheon a year later. As well as painting altarpieces for Roman churches, his work also attracted collectors in France. His polished mythological and religious subjects were collected by art lovers. Turchi maintained fruitful connections with Verona throughout his career. "

He executed numerous works in the churches of Bologna, in particular a Marriage of St Catherine, and a Christ the Redeemer (in Santa Caterina). On going to Rome he obtained the patronage of the Cardinal of Savoy; and he painted there some frescoes, as well as paintings in oil. Among his pupils were Giacinto Brandi. "

The only picture reasonably certainly his is the altarpiece with a Madonna Enthroned with Saints (1480) painted  for Santa Maria in Porto at Ravenna and now in the Brera, Milan. Other works, however, can be confidently given to him because of his distinctive style. "

Although he came from an impoverished background, he entered the Académie of Tournai in 1823, where he worked first under Cornelis Cels and then under Philippe Auguste Hennequin, a pupil of Jacques-Louis David. Hennequin instilled in him the principles of Neo-classical drawing and had a profound influence on his choice of subject-matter. Gallait's first Classical subject, the Death of Epaminondas (Musée des Beaux-Arts, Tournai), and his many early drawings show this influence clearly. Gallait's first success was with Caesar's Tribute (Museum voor Schone Kunsten, Ghent) exhibited in 1832 at the Salon of Ghent. On the advice of Hennequin, Gallait went to Antwerp to continue his training under Mathieu Van Bree. Here he discovered the Baroque colour of Peter Paul Rubens and the nascent Romanticism of Gustaf Wappers. During this period he produced a Christ Healing the Blind Man, which was bought by the cathedral of Tournai (in situ). Gallait used the proceeds of this sale to go to Paris to continue his studies. He familiarized himself with the Old Master works in the Louvre and sought to achieve a calm and restrained Romanticism in such works as the Oath of Vargas (Wallace Collection, London). He received commissions for the Musée Historique at Versailles, including a portrait of Charles de Gontant, Duc de Biron (Versailles, Château), which, with the Oath of Vargas and Job (Musée des Beaux-Arts, Lille), was exhibited at the Salon of 1836 in Paris. He settled in Brussels, and as an artist employed by the State he exercised considerable influence, and for a long period he was the leader of public taste in Brussels. "

41267,Giovanni Battista Carlone,1592,1677,"Painter, part of an Italian family of artists, son of Taddeo Carlone (1543–1615), a sculptor, and brother of the painter Giovanni Carlone (1584-1630). He probably went to Rome with his brother and studied in Florence with Domenico Passignano on the way back to Genoa. The many frescoes datable to the 1620s suggest that the brothers probably worked as a team. Giovanni Battista's independent activity is not documented before 1630-32, when he finished the frescoes begun by his brother in S Antonio Abate in Milan. His earliest dated work is a canvas of St James Opening the Door for King Ferdinand (1632; Genoa, oratory of S Giacomo della Marina), which shows figures with sharp facial features and twisting, tight drapery folds - a figure style indebted to Salvator Rosa and distinctly different from the slightly swollen faces and hands in the figures by Giovanni Carlone I. He spent most of his life in his native Genoa, painting mainly for local religious buildings and private patrons. Giovanni Battista Carlone's studio produced a vast quantity of brilliantly coloured frescoes, which were highly proficient and popular; these are best seen on the nave vaults of the large Genoese churches, S Ambrogio and S Siro. He relied on family members, and among his 24 children were Simon Carlone, Niccolo Carlone (1644-1714) and Giovanni Andrea Carlone, who assisted him and kept the studio alive until the end of the 17th century.

He accompanied his father to Dublin, where he worked for architect James Gandon, despite a suspicion that the elder Malton had anonymously published severe criticism of Gandon's designs for the Royal Exchange in Dublin. In the 1790s James Malton returned to London, where he supported himself as a topographical artist, exhibiting some fifty-one drawings, designs for, and elevations of buildings at the Royal Academy between 1792 and 1803. In 1797 he published a handsome volume of illustrations with text, A Descriptive View of Dublin. In the following year he published An Essay on British Cottage Architecture (which went into a second edition in 1804) and in 1802 A Collection of Designs for Rural Retreats. These two works of Malton's have aquatint illustrations of an exceptionally high quality and delicacy. Malton's importance as a pioneer of the cottage orné has been recognized. James Malton died at his home in Norton Street on 28 July 1803 from brain fever and was buried in Marylebone churchyard. The contents of his studio and his effects were auctioned at Christies on 8 and 9 March 1804. "

In 1486 Peregrinationes in terram sanctam, written by Breydenbach and illustrated with woodcuts by Reuwich, was published and became highly popular as a travel guide. The woodcuts, which fold out to show townscapes, including Venice and Jerusalem, made this publication technically as well as artistically an exceptional achievement. The title page, with a richly dressed Venetian lady, and other smaller woodcuts showing inhabitants of the Holy Land, are similar in style to prints by the Master of the Housebook. "

He was a pupil of Felice Brusasorci, but he soon moved to Venice, where he studied the art of Jacopo Tintoretto in particular, but also that of Jacopo Bassano and of Veronese, whose works he copied in chiaroscuro drawings (mainly Windsor Castle, Royal Library) similar to those of Domenico Tintoretto. Bassetti's early painted Portrait of a Man with a Glove (Verona, Castelvecchio) is essentially Venetian, close to the art of Bassano; his St Peter and St Andrew (both Moruri, S Zeno), both unrefined, rustic works, are similar in style and must also be rare examples of his early paintings. By 1616 Bassetti (like many other north Italian artists) had settled in Rome, then the centre of artistic experimentation in Italy. Having absorbed a form of Caravaggism he returned to Verona, where in the paintings of his last decade he attempted, not entirely successfully, to fuse the directness of contemporary Roman painting with the monumental compositions of the Venetian High Renaissance.

40499,Peter Cornelius,1783,1867,"German painter, best known for the major part he played in the revival of fresco in the 19th century. After training at the Düsseldorf Academy Cornelius moved to Italy in 1811 and joined the Nazarenes in Rome. In 1819 he was called to Munich by Crown Prince Ludwig of Bavaria (later Ludwig I), for whom he worked extensively, notably on a series of frescos in the Ludwigskirche (1836-39), including a Last Judgement that is larger than Michelangelo's in the Sistine Chapel. When this work was not well received Cornelius left Munich to work for Frederick William IV of Prussia in Berlin. His major undertaking there was a commission for frescos in a mausoleum for the royal family. The project was officially cancelled after the revolution in 1848, but Cornelius continued to work on his drawings for it for the rest of his life. Cornelius's work is undoubtedly impressive, but rather self-conscious in its desire to revive the heroic pictorial language of Raphael and Michelangelo, and combine it with the didactic philosophy of German Romanticism. He was director of the academies at Düsseldorf and Munich and his influence was considerable; it may well be claimed that his works in Munich sparked off the revival of large-scale fresco decoration in Germany and perhaps elsewhere. His advice was sought when frescos were painted in the Houses of Parliament, London in the 1840s. "

35960,Robert Nanteuil,1623,1678,"French engraver, draughtsman and pastellist. He was the son of Lancelot Nanteuil, a wool merchant, and submitted his thesis in philosophy, for which he engraved the headpiece, at the Jesuit College of Reims, in 1645. He went on to work in the studio of Nicolas Regnesson, whose sister he married in 1646, before moving to Paris in 1647. His early work mainly consisted of portrait drawings in black lead on parchment (e.g. Paris, Louvre), and he continued to draw throughout his career. He took 155 of his 221 portraits directly from life. His drawing style was influenced by Philippe de Champaigne, and he based his engraving technique on the work of Claude Mellan and Jean Morin. By 1652 he had developed his own technique, and his engraving of Cardinal Mazarin of that year gained him official recognition. The size of his engravings increased, and after 1664 he produced mainly life-size heads. In 1658 he was appointed Dessinateur et Graveur Ordinaire du Roi. "

14952,Jean Le Pautre,1618,1682,"Designer and engraver, part of a French family of artists. Adrien Le Pautre was a master joiner. Of his three notable sons Jean Le Pautre was a designer and printmaker, whose published works, sold singly or in sets, were an important conduit for disseminating French architectural taste throughout Europe in the 17th century. Jean Le Pautre was active as a printmaker from 1643 but was most prolific in the 1660s. His output was prodigious, with 2348 prints having been recorded, and his range of subjects was extremely broad: interior decoration, including specific studies for bed alcoves, chimney-pieces, ceilings, wallpapers, furniture, friezes, vases, trophies, tapestry, garden ornament and grottoes were all explored in detail and executed with remarkable facility. He was equally at home delineating landscape and the human figure. Le Pautre's engravings are notable for their richness and their spirited and vivacious conception. Bernini held him in high respect, and clearly the admiration was returned. This is most evident in Le Pautre's set of engravings devoted to garden ornaments, which have elaborately ornamented borders that exhibit the same plasticity and movement found in Bernini's sculptures. Le Pautre's knowledge of Italian art was probably acquired second-hand: in 1645 he engraved a series of drawings of antique and Baroque ornament made by his teacher, Adam Philippon, in Italy. In 1670 he is recorded as being in the employ of the crown, and in 1677 he was elected to the Académie Française as a dessignateur and graveur. Many of his works were reprinted in 1751 by the publisher Jombert. According to Guilmard, Le Pautre was responsible for instigating the Louis XIV style, the grandiose and sumptuous character of which is evident in his prints. "

111606,Carlo Francesco Nuvolone,,,"Member of an Italian family of painters. Panfilo Nuvolone painted many frescoes and altarpieces, in a style still linked to late Mannerism, and a number of more original still-lifes. His son Carlo Francesco Nuvolone, who responded to early 17th-century Milanese art, was a more powerful artist. He became the leading painter in Lombardy in the mid-17th century, producing frescoes, altarpieces, devotional works and portraits. Carlo's younger brother Giuseppe Nuvolone assisted him. Giuseppe's art is of lower quality, yet richer in colour, and his many religious works spread the Baroque style throughout Lombardy. Carlo Francesco first studied with his father and subsequently at the Accademia Ambrosiana in Milan, where he was a pupil of Cerano and came into contact with Daniele Crespi and Giulio Cesare Procaccini. His first signed and dated work, the Miracle of St Martha (1636; Venegono Inferiore, Seminario Arcivescovile), which is much influenced by Morazzone and Giulio Cesare Procaccini, suggests his response to new artistic developments in Milan. The Death of Lucrezia (private collection), of which there are several versions, is probably slightly later. This work exhibits the soft, atmospheric quality of his art, often explained by his knowledge of Murillo, which, however, is difficult to establish. His contacts with Crespi, Francesco Cairo and above all with Giulio Cesare Procaccini, were of greater significance; from the last-named he learnt how to achieve a delicate modulation of light and shade and to impart sweet facial expressions to his figures. In the 1640s he painted many altarpieces that suggest an awareness of van Dyck, whose work he knew through Valerio Castello and Giovanni Andrea de' Ferrari. Outstanding are the Purification of the Virgin (1645; Piacenza, Museo Civico), the Assumption of the Virgin (1646; Milan, Brera) and the Virgin in Glory with Saints (1647; Parma, Galleria Nazionale). In these paintings Nuvolone reveals himself to have been heir to the first generation of innovative painters in 17th-century Lombardy, although he used a less dramatic language, which also reflects an awareness of Emilian art.

37224,Anthonie Waterloo,1609,1690,"Dutch painter and printmaker. Little is known of his early life and, as no records of any formal training as an artist have been discovered, he may well have been self-taught. Although registered as a painter, he had little success in selling his own canvases and, apparently, supported himself through his activities as an art dealer in addition to sales of his drawings and prints. In 1640 he married in Amsterdam, and in 1653 he moved to Leeuwarden, but in 1654 he buried a daughter in Amsterdam before moving to Maarssen in 1655 where he lived until 1676. He was good friends with Jan Weenix who often visited him in his house to decorate his landscape paintings with animals and other objects. Waterloo was among the first artists to have established a reputation almost entirely based upon his work as a draftsman. Oil paintings by Waterloo are relatively scarce, but his many drawings of forest scenes and other topographical views are found in collections in Berlin, Munich, Hamburg, Vienna, Amsterdam, and London. A landscape artist, Waterloo also produced many etchings which increased his popularity and extended his influence into the next century and beyond to the French Barbizon painters of the mid-19th century. While many of Waterloo's larger etchings and drawings (some almost the size of his paintings) are careful in their depiction of the smallest, individual detail, his smaller drawings of mountain valley views often feature an impressionistic group of forms as atmospheric perspective leads the eye into the hilly distance along a characteristically Baroque zig-zag course. Such drawings may have been known to the English landscape etcher John Robert Cozens and, in turn, may have had a stylistic impact upon the young Turner. His art dealership exposed him to the work of a number of respected contemporary landscape artists such as Jacob van Ruisdael, Simon de Vlieger, Roelandt Roghman, and Caesar van Everdingen, from whom he absorbed a variety of influences. Judging from the locales depicted in his drawings, he traveled widely and his trips to Germany, Switzerland, France, Poland. and even Italy have since been theorized. In Germany, he made a trip along the Rhine river, and visited various towns such as Kleef, Bentheim, Hamburg, Altona, Hamburg, Blankenese, Holstein, Bergedorf, Lüneburg en Gdañsk. Waterloo was active in Amsterdam, Leeuwarden, and Utrecht, where he died in 1690. "

As a young man he traveled and sketched throughout Europe before returning to the U.S. to join a westward-bound expedition in 1859. In a career spanning the entire second half of the 19th century, he emerged as the first technically sophisticated artist to travel to the Far West of America, adapt European and Hudson River School prototypes to a new landscape and produce paintings powerful in their nationalistic and religious symbolism. Specializing in grandiose pictures of vast mountain scenery, he achieved great popularity in his lifetime with panoramic and often fanciful scenes of the American West, including The Rocky Mountains (1863) and Mount Corcoran (c. 1875-77). His huge paintings were actually executed in his New York City studio. "

Zoffany, after studying in Germany and Italy, went to England about 1758. Following the lead of William Hogarth, he painted scenes from London's theatrical productions. Notable in this genre are his paintings of the famed actor David Garrick in his many West End successes - e.g., The Farmer's Return (1762). His portraits were popular with George III, who became his patron and for whom he produced Queen Charlotte with Her Sons, the Prince of Wales and the Duke of York. In 1772 Zoffany went to Italy with the king's financial help and there, during a seven-year stay, executed The Tribuna of the Uffizi (1780) for the royal family. This celebrated work shows a group of connoisseurs admiring paintings and sculptures in the Uffizi Gallery in Florence. He worked as a portraitist in India from 1783 to 1789, and when he returned to England he painted such notable portraits as Charles Towneley Among His Marbles (1790). Zoffany was a founder-member of the Royal Academy (1768). He possessed brilliant technical skills and introduced greater liveliness and personal anecdote into English conversation pieces. "

35560,Nicolaes Maes,1632,1693,"Dutch painter. In about 1648 he became a pupil of Rembrandt in Amsterdam, staying there until 1654 when he returned to his native town Dordrecht. In his early years he concentrated on genre pictures, rather sentimental in approach, but distinguished by deep glowing colours he had learnt from his master. Old women sleeping, praying, or reading the Bible were subjects he particularly favoured. In the 1660s, however, Maes began to turn more to portraiture, and after a visit to Antwerp around the middle of the decade his style changed dramatically. He abandoned the reddish tone of his earlier manner for a wider, lighter and cooler range (greys and blacks in the shadows instead of brownish tones), and the fashionable portraits he now specialized in were closer to van Dyck than to Rembrandt. In 1673 he moved permanently to Amsterdam and had great success with this kind of picture. Maes was a fairly prolific painter and is well represented in, for example, the National Gallery, London, and the museum at Dordrecht."

35833,Jean Morin,1600,1650,"French engraver. Very little is known of his life beyond what may be learnt from his prints. His work consists mainly of reproductive portraits after Philippe de Champaigne and van Dyck, and landscapes after Jacques Fouquier. He is said to have started his career as a painter, but no painting by him is known. Six of his landscape prints are his own compositions. He is chiefly remarkable for his technique, which, although it was developed out of that of the school of van Dyck, was largely his own invention. His plates were first etched and then finished in a mixture of line and stipple, with the latter dominating. This strikingly personal system produced very effective portraits in which the character of the sitter is well expressed. His best work was after Philippe de Champaigne, notably portraits of François Potier, Marquis de Gèvres, Arnaud d'Andilly, René de Longueil, Marquis de Maisons, Henri de Lorraine, Comte d'Harcourt and Antoine Vitré. His particular skill lay in producing contrasts of tone between the different parts of his plates, although this sometimes led to inharmonious juxtapositions. He employed an unusual printing procedure, each tirage being on a separate quire of paper and the quires being used in the same sequence for each of his portraits. "

He took over his brother's fluorishing studio, continuing the work at Caprarola in the palace of the Farnese family, and also the decoration of the Sala Regia in the Vatican (begun by Taddeo in 1561). His talent was no more exceptional than Taddeo's, but he became even more successful and won himself a European reputation - indeed for a time he was probably the most famous living painter. In 1573-74 he travelled via Lorraine and the Netherlands to England, where he is said to have painted portraits of the Queen and many courtiers, although only two drawings in the British Museum can safely be attributed to him. (Many anonymous portraits of the period are improbably attributed to him.) After working in Florence, Rome, and Venice, he was invited to the Escorial by Philip II of Spain, where he painted a number of altarpieces (1585-88). Back in Rome he was elected the first President of the new Accademia di San Luca, founded in 1593, to which he later gave his house as headquarters. Like many of his contemporaries he believed that correct theory would produce good works of art and himself wrote L'Idea de' Pittori, Scultori, et Architetti (1607). Zuccaro also worked as an architect, designing a doorway in the form of a grotesque face (one enters through the open mouth) for his own house (the Palazzo Zuccaro, now the Biblioteca Hertziana). The two flanking windows are treated in similar bizarre fashion. "

2300,Nicolas Bertin,1668,1736,"French painter and draughtsman. In 1678 he was apprenticed to Guy-Louis Vernansal; he later became a pupil of Jean Jouvenet and in 1684-85 of Bon Boullogne. By 1684 he was enrolled at the Académie Royale, Paris, and a year later won the Prix de Rome with his Construction of Noah's Ark (untraced). He probably arrived in Rome towards the end of 1685, and he stayed until the winter of 1688-89. While in Italy he studied the work of Raphael and the Carracci family, as well as showing an interest in Correggio. He also led a student protest against the teaching régime of the Académie de France in Rome. After some months in Lyon he returned to Paris in 1689 and began to work on minor commissions, including drawings of the statues in the park at Versailles (Paris, Bibliothèque Nationale). The influence of the Boullogne brothers is evident in his small-scale paintings of this time, such as Mercury Killing Argus (c. 1690-95; destroyed), with its graceful but stylized figures and clear, Flemish-derived colours. Two works of the turn of the century, Joseph and Potiphar's Wife and Susanna and the Elders (both 1699; Amsterdam, Rijksmuseum), indicate that he was in the forefront of the contemporary movement in religious art towards small-scale works destined for private collectors. Although sacred, the subjects were capable of a secular interpretation, and Bertin exploited this ambiguity to the full. "

He was nicknamed `Luca Fa Presto' (Luke work quickly) because of his prodigious speed of execution and huge output. He began in the circle of Ribera, but his style became much more colorful under the influence of such great decorative painters as Veronese, whose works he saw on his extensive travels. Indeed, he absorbed a host of influences and was said to be able to imitate other artists' styles with ease. His work was varied also in subject-matter, although he was primarily a religious and mythological painter. He worked mainly in Naples, but also extensively in Florence and Venice, and his work had great influence in Italy. After five years back in Naples, Giordano went to Florence again where he produced one of his most important works, the gallery frescoes in the Palazzo Medici-Riccardi (1682). These airy, luminous frescos provide a foretaste of eighteenth century art. In 1692 he was called to Spain by Charles II and stayed there for 10 years, painting in Madrid, Toledo, and the Escorial. His last work when he returned to Naples was the ceiling of the Treasury Chapel of San Martino. In his personal self-confidence and courtliness, and in the open, airy compositions and light luminous colors of his work, Giordano presages such great 18th-century painters as Tiepolo. "

He was elected to the Academy in 1735, and became the most famous member of the family in France, being appointed Principal Painter to the King in 1762, and Director of the Academy in 1763.

37048,John Henry Twachtman,1853,1902,"American painter and printmaker. He began as a painter of window-shades but developed one of the most personal and poetic visions in American landscape painting, portraying nature on canvases. His first artistic training was under Frank Duveneck (1848-1919), with whom he studied first in Cincinnati. Most leading American artists of the late nineteenth century journeyed to Europe to study, usually to France. Twachtman went first to Germany where he worked at the Munich Royal Academy and adopted the forceful brushstrokes, heavy application of paint, and limited, low-key palette that were associated with the circle of Wilhelm Leibl. His absorption of the Munich style, characterized by bravura brushwork and dexterous manipulation of pigment, with the lights painted as directly as possible into warm, dark grounds derived from Frans Hals and Courbet, is reflected in such paintings as Venice Landscape (1878; Museum of Fine Arts, Boston) and Landscape (c. 1882; Munson-Williams-Proctor Institute, Utica). Later, however, after spending a few years back in America, he went to Paris, where he studied from 1883 to 1885 at the Académie Julian in Paris, and his paintings dramatically shifted towards a soft, gray and green tonalist style. In 1886 he returned to America and settled in Connecticut. Many of his exquisite and atmospheric landscapes in oil and pastel were inspired by the countryside near his home in Greenwich, Conn. He also painted a series of landscapes at Yellowstone Park and at Niagara Falls. He did not live to enjoy the high reputation his work now holds. Twachtman is represented in many American galleries. Characteristic works are Waterfall (Metropolitan Museum, New York), The Hemlock Pool (Addison Gallery of American Art, Andover, Mass.), and Summer (Phillips Memorial Gallery, Washington). "

6656,Giovanni di Paolo,,,"Giovanni di Paolo di Grazia, one of the most important Italian painters of the 15th-century Sienese school. He is chiefly notable for carrying the brilliantly colourful vision of Sienese 14th-century paintings on into the Renaissance. His early works show the influence of previous Sienese masters, his landscapes and his figures still reverberate with echoes of Duccio's work, but his later style grew steadily more individualized, characterized by vigorous, harsh colors and elongated forms. His art most beautifully reflects the 15th-century artistic conservatism of a commercially declining city. Many of his works have an unusual dreamlike atmosphere, such as the surrealistic Saint Nicholas of Tolentino Saving a Ship (1455?, Philadelphia Museum of Art), while his last works - particularly Last Judgment, Heaven, and Hell (1465?) and  Assumption of the Virgin (1475), both at Pinacoteca, Siena - are grotesque treatments of their lofty subjects. Giovanni's reputation declined after his death but was revived in the 20th century.  "
35425,Charles Le Brun,1619,1690,"French painter and art theorist, the dominant artist of Louis XIV's reign. His father, the sculptor Nicolas Le Brun the Elder, sent him at a very young age to study under François Perrier, and later under Simon Vouet. Le Brun copied various paintings at Fontainebleau and from the age of 15, painted several compositions for Cardinal Richelieu; Poussin, who was then in Paris, found them interesting.

Le Brun's output was prolific. When he was not painting, he produced etchings, drawings based on doctrines, and wax models. Chancellor Séguier, who was his faithful protector, paid him a salary so that in 1642 he could go to Italy, and entrusted him to Poussin, who was returning to Rome. Le Brun worked under Poussin, becoming a convert to the latter's theories of art. In 1646, Le Brun went back to France, settled in Lyons where he produced a number of works and returned to Paris with the reputation of an accomplished artist. From then on he was overwhelmed with commissions. In 1647, he painted Martyrdom of St Andrew for the goldsmiths, which was designed for Notre-Dame. In 1648, he took an active part in the establishment of the academy, where he was a dominant force until the end of his career. In 1649, he collaborated with Le Sueur on the decoration of l'Hôtel Lambert. Minister of Finance Nicolas Fouquet paid him a salary of 12,000 livres and put him in charge of the decoration of his château at Vaux (Vaux-le-Vicomte). Le Brun met Cardinal Mazarin at Fouquet's château, who presented him to Louis XIV and the queen mother. She commissioned a painting of Christ with Angels for his chapel, which enjoyed considerable success. Le Brun was commissioned to decorate Place Dauphine after the king's marriage to the Infanta Maria Teresa (daughter of the King of Spain, Philip IV). In 1660, the king who was at Fontainebleau, commissioned him to paint several subjects on the history of Alexander. In the presence of Louis XIV, Le Brun painted The Family of Darius; the sovereign was so satisfied with it that he offered the painter his portrait enriched with diamonds and appointed him as premier peintre ('First Painter to the King') in July 1662 with a salary of 12,000 livres. In 1662 he was raised to nobility. The king put him in charge of his pictures and drawings, with the task of buying painting and sculpture that he deemed worthy of enriching the royal collection. The fire in the painting gallery at the Louvre, on 6 February 1661, provided Le Brun with the opportunity to express his talent as a great decorator. He designed the general plan for the Galerie d'Apollon, producing all the designs for paintings, sculptures, and ornaments, but he only painted four pieces. As the creation of Versailles absorbed the attention of the sovereign, the works to be carried out at the Louvre were postponed. In 1663 he was made director of the reorganized Gobelins factory, where there was a network of workshops supplying tapestries, furniture, gold work and silverware, locksmiths, mosaics, and the Crown's marquetry. Le Brun's influence here was considerable. He designed everything and supervised production. Also in 1663 he was made director of the reorganized Académie, which he turned into a channel for imposing a codified system of orthodoxy in matters of art. His lectures came to be accepted as providing the official standards of artistic correctness and, formulated on the basis of the classicism of Poussin, gave authority to the view that every aspect of artistic creation can be reduced to teachable rule and precept. In 1666, Le Brun used his influence to establish a French School in Rome. In 1677, we find him accompanying the king during the Flanders campaign and on his return producing paintings at the Château de St-Germain. The previous year, the Accademia de San Luca, in Rome, had elected him principal and director. In spite of the pictures painted for Louis XIV and the many designs for statues in the park at Versailles, Le Brun still found the time to decorate a château for Colbert and the Pavillons de Sceaux. The indefatigable artist also painted the façades for the Pavillons de Marly and the Great Staircase at Versailles. In 1679, he undertook the painting and decoration of the Galerie des Glaces ('Hall of Mirrors') at Versailles, a colossal room exceeding 80 metres x 12 metres. Le Brun devoted four years to it, painting Louis XIV in various guises in 21 pictures and 6 low reliefs. He also decorated the Salon de la Paix ('Salon of Peace') at one end and the Salon de la Guerre ('Salon of War') at the other end of the gallery. Colbert's death was a terrible blow to Le Brun's career. Louvois hated everything his predecessor had nurtured. In his official capacity as Superintendent of Buildings, Louvois could create a multitude of impediments and many obstacles for Le Brun. Until then, the painter, who reigned supreme, had dictated all artistic matters; which, although he bestowed a majestic unity on the formal beauty of Louis XIV's reign and had banned any originality diverging from the orthodoxy defined by the academy, he had compromised the artistic evolution of the period. Silent opposition and Louvois's criticism affected Le Brun's health, probably already exhausted by the relentless efforts that these works demanded. He stopped going to the Court, in spite of the favour the king had always shown him, and a decline ended his life. Despite the classicism of his theories, Le Brun's own talents lay rather in the direction of flamboyant and grandiose decorative effects. Among the most outstanding of his works for the king were the Galerie d'Apollon at the Louvre (1663), and the famous Galerie des Glaces (1679-84) and the Great Staircase (1671-78, destroyed in 1752) at Versailles. His importance in the history of French art is twofold: his contributions to the magnificence of the Grand Manner of Louis XIV and his influence in laying the basis of academicism. Many of the leading French artists of the next generation trained in his studio. Le Brun was a fine portraitist and an extremely prolific draughtsman."

57171,Eliel Saarinen,1873,1950,"Finnish architect, urban planner and designer. From 1893 to 1897, Saarinen studied painting at Helsinki University and architecture at Helsinki Polytechnic. He later painted only as a hobby. In 1896, while still a student, he founded the architectural firm of Gesellius, Lindgren & Saarinen, known as GLS, together with Herman Geselius (1874-1916) and Armas Eliel Lindgren (1874-1929). Alongside public buildings, they also designed private villas, in which they realized the principle of total work of art (e.g. Suur-Merijoki manor house in Viipuri, 1903). For this reason, from the 1890s onwards, Saarinen also designed furniture, like his buildings drew upon Finnish tradition. Saarinen's first buildings were strongly influenced by the Finnish Gothic Revival and the English Arts and Crafts Movement. Their interiors, which frequently originated from the workshop of Gallen-Kallela, revealed predominantly Art Nouveau elements. In his later buildings, forms became more abstract. His most important work was Helsinki Central Station (designed 1904, built 1910-14). Despite individual projects, however, the dominant theme of Saarinen's work in the decade from 1910 was urban planning. He attempted to solve the traffic and commercial space problems of the growing Helsinki by proposing two new roads for the city centre. Saarinen's 'total' approach to design is seen in these new city streets, for which he also designed buildings, including their interiors. The most comprehensive of Saarinen's urban visions was his plan for Munkkiniemi-Haaga (1910-15), a new suburb of Helsinki for 170,000 inhabitants, to be built with private funds. In 1922, Saarinen took part in the American Chicago Tribune Competition and won second prize. His proposal, with a stepped-in profile and avoiding overt historical references, proved very popular, differing clearly from other entries representing the European avant-garde. Many American buildings of the 1920s reflected Saarinen's vision. In 1923, he emigrated to the United States, where he opened an office in Evanston, Illinois, transferring it to Ann Arbor, Michigan, in 1924. The architecture of Saarinen's late period was marked by the arrival of his son Eero Saarinen (1910-1961) in the office in the late 1930s. "

34326,Karel Dujardin,1617,1678,"Dutch Romanist painter and etcher, best known for his spirited representations of Italian peasants and shepherds with their animals. Karel Dujardin was baptised in the Lutheran Church in Amsterdam on 27 September 1626. He was the son of the candlemaker ('smeersmelter') Charel Dujardin and Cathalyne Borckhout. Houbraken reported that he was a pupil of Nicolaes Berchem. On 29 August 1650, Dujardin signed a deed in which he is described as a 'merchant about to leave for Paris'. According to Houbraken, he was married in Lyon, which was a port of call for many Dutch painters on their way to or from Italy. Dujardin may have continued his journey from Paris to Lyon and perhaps proceeded from there to Italy: a fair number of his paintings are of Italian figures or landscapes. He must have returned from his travels and got married before September 1652, because on the fifteenth of that month he and his wife Suzanna van Royen drew up a will in Amsterdam. In or shortly before 1656, Dujardin moved to The Hague, where he was involved in the establishment of the painters' association Pictura. He himself was a member of the association from 1656 to 1658. Dujardin was back in Amsterdam in May i659, and remained there until 1675. In May 1672, he and several other Amsterdam painters were asked to appraise a number of Italian paintings, from which we can infer that he was considered an expert. He was more than able to make ends meet: in Amsterdam he lived in a house on the fashionable Herengracht, and in an inventory made of his chattels and movables indicates that in his maturity he enjoyed considerable wealth. In August 1675, Dujardin set sail for Italy (his second visit?) with his friend Joan Reynst. Houbraken says he intended to accompany Reynst only as far as the North Sea island of Texel but changed his mind en route and continued the voyage to Italy. The ship also called on Tangiers in North Africa. Dujardin initially stayed in Rome, where he was known to the Dutch painters working in Italy as 'Bokkebaert', the Dutch word for 'goatee'. He later moved to Venice and was buried there on 9 October 1678. Dujardin was a versatile artist who painted landscapes, cattle and portraits as well as religious and mythological scenes. "

10229,Valentine Green,1739,1813,"English engraver. He was placed by his father in a solicitor's office at Evesham, where he remained for two years. In 1760, he decided to abandon the legal profession and became a pupil of Robert Hancock, a line engraver at Worcester. In 1764 combined his artistic and antiquarian skills in a Survey of the City of Worcester, with 15 illustrations drawn by him and engraved by Hancock. In 1765 he moved to London and began work as a mezzotint engraver, having taught himself the technicalities of this art, and quickly rose to a position in the front rank of British engravers. He became mezzotint engraver to George III in 1773 and an associate engraver of the Royal Academy the following year. For some forty years he followed his profession with the greatest success. The exclusive right of engraving and publishing plates from the pictures in Dusseldorf gallery was granted him by the duke of Bavaria in 1789, but, after he had issued more than twenty of these plates, the siege of that city by the French put an end to this undertaking. Suffering serious financial loss, he was reduced to poverty. He took the post of keeper of the British Institution in 1805, and continued in this office for the remainder of his life. Although he was very prolific, his work is of the highest quality, delicate and precise. He is particularly associated with Benjamin West and Joshua Reynolds and largely established his reputation with his engravings Regulus Returning to Carthage (1771; British Museum, London) and Hannibal Swearing Enmity to the Romans (1773; British Museum, London), both after West. During his career as an engraver he produced some four hundred plates after portraits by Reynolds, Romney, and other British artists, after the compositions of Benjamin West, and after pictures by Van Dyck, Rubens, Murillo, and other old masters. He was one of the first engravers to show how admirably mezzotint could be applied to the translation of pictorial compositions as well as portraits. "

Together with Van Spaendonck, De Lelie left in 1773 for Antwerp, where he mainly painted history scenes and portraits. On the advice of friends, in 1783 De Lelie moved to Amsterdam. Here he developed into a popular portrait painter, especially among the enlightened, progressive citizens. Many prominent contemporaries in Dutch cultural life commissioned De Lelie to paint their portrait. His paintings of art galleries with visitors are the precursors of the conversation piece, a genre that became popular in the nineteenth century. "

Munkácsy painted his genres in the style of realism between 1873 and 1875: Tramps at Night, Farewell. Churning Woman, Woman Carryng Brushwood, and Pawnshop were the zenith of his career. He married the widow of Baron de Marches in 1874, and his style changed from that time on. Departing from the typical subjects of realism, be produced colourful salon paintings and still-lifes. This was the period when be also turned to ladscape painting; his growing interest is marked by such great paintings as Dusty Road. Corn Field, and Walking in the Woods. The assimilation of László Paál's style is apparent in the landscapes painted during the 1880s, such as Line of Trees and The Colpach Park. His realist portraits - e.g. of Franz Liszt and Cardinal Haynald - were also born around this time, together with his religions paintings, such as the so-called Trilogy: Christ before Pilate, Golgotha and later, Ecce homo. Towards the end of his career he painted two monumental works: Hungarian Conquest for the House of Parliament and a fresco entitled Apotheosis of Renaissance, for the ceiling Kunsthistoriches.

From 1876 to 1878 he apprenticed with Louis Aucoc, a noted Parisian jeweller. Unable to further his training in France, he went to London to study at Sydenham College, which specialized in the graphic arts. On his return to Paris in 1880, he found employment as a jewellery designer creating models for firms like Cartier and Boucheron. By the 1890s, he had opened his workshop in Paris and become one of the most admired jewellers of the day. He rejected the current trend for diamonds in grand settings, instead used such gemstones as bloodstones, tourmalines, cornelians and chrysoberyls together with plique à jour enamelling and inexpensive metals for his creations. His jewellery, which was in the Art Nouveau style, included hair combs, collars, brooches, necklaces and buckles, and he also branched out into metalwork, producing gold boxes, inkwells and daggers. His favourite motifs included flowers and insects - poppies and anemones, and dragonflies and scarabs. His international reputation was established at the Exposition Universelle in 1887 in Paris and by securing such patrons as the actress Sarah Bernhardt (1844-1933). In 1898 Lalique established a glass workshop in Clairfontaine where he largely employed the cire perdue process. In 1907 he was commissioned by François Coty to design some labels for his perfume bottles; Lalique also designed and created perfume bottles for other perfumers. In 1910 he bought a glassworks in Combs-la-Ville and in 1919 another in Wingen-sur-Moder, Alsace. At the latter, he employed the press-moulding technique for mass-produced items including light fittings, vases, table lamps, clockcases, bowls, ashtrays, ceiling fittings, furniture and car mascots, all of which were designed in the Art Deco style.

41527,"Lorck, Melchior",1527,1588,"Danish draughtsman, engraver, woodcut designer, painter, architect, surveyor and author. Facts about his highly productive career, which ranged from Denmark to Turkey, come primarily from an autobiographical letter of 1 January 1563 to King Frederick II of Denmark to whom he owed allegiance by birth; also from inscribed works, his letters and mostly unpublished material in archives in Vienna, Hamburg, Antwerp and Copenhagen. From an early age, he exhibited considerable artistic abilities. King Christian III offered to finance Lorck's education abroad, on the condition that he later served as court artist. Lorck visited the chief artistic centres in Germany, the Netherlands and Italy, but when the money ran out, he did not return to his benefactor as he had promised. Instead he made his living at minor princely courts, until he was employed in Vienna in 1555 by Ferdinand I, the future Holy Roman Emperor. Ferdinand ordered Lorck to accompany a diplomatic mission to Constantinople (Istanbul), Turkey. The goal was to negotiate peace with the Ottoman Empire. Lorck's role was to record the Ottoman's way of life to improve Western knowledge of the culture of Turkey. When Lorck returned to Vienna in 1559, his sketches from the journey were worked up in 128 woodcuts in all, which are known today under the title of The Turkish Publication. This apparently restless artist never achieved a final completion of the work, however. He never realised the projected publication himself. Instead, Lorck returned to Denmark in 1580, where the new king, Frederik II, restored him to favour and gave him work. But just two years later, the aging Lorck travelled off again, leaving few traces of his later movements. His final works are, surprisingly enough, motifs from the Gold Coast in West Africa. The Turkish Publication was first printed in 1626. "

He showed artistic inclinations as a boy and was encouraged to draw by his father, the portrait painter and miniaturist Thomas Crane (1808-1859). A series of illustrations to Tennyson's The Lady of Shalott was shown first to Ruskin, who praised the use of colour and then to the engraver William James Linton (1812-1898), to whom Crane was apprenticed in 1859. From 1859 to 1862 Crane learnt a technique of exact and economical draughtsmanship on woodblocks. He concentrated his output from 1864 onwards on book illustration. He joined the Art Worker's Guild in 1884 and became one of the leading figures of the Arts and Crafts Exhibitions Society in 1888. From 1894 onwards he worked for William Morris's Kelmscott Press. Crane's work is strongly influenced by the Pre-Raphaelites and also by Florentine Quattrocento art, which he studied intensively during his two journeys to Italy (in 1871 and 1888). He is famous for his illustrations for fairy tales which are reminiscences of Japanese colour prints. For the arts and crafts trade, he designed carpets, wallpaper, embroidery, and majolica tiles. He also made a major contribution to the stylistic development of Art Nouveau as a theoretician. "

69237,Georg Jensen,1866,1935,"Danish silversmith and sculptor. Jensen was apprenticed to a goldsmith in his teens; he later studied sculpture at the Kunstakademiet in Copenhagen. Unable to make a living as a sculptor, Jensen returned to silversmithing and worked for Mogens Ballin (1871-1941), whose fleshy and organic interpretation of Art Nouveau strongly influenced his designs. Jensen set up his first workshop, primarily making jewellery, in Copenhagen in 1904. His early designs show the influence of Art Nouveau, often characterized by full, simple forms incorporating stylized bird and flower motifs. In 1906 he produced his first complete set of flatware, 'Continental', which was still in production in the 1980s. Distinctive for its restraint and the interplay between its strong silhouette and a surface animated by small hammer marks, it is a clear expression of his involvement with the Arts and Crafts Movement. Many of Jensen's most famous pieces were produced between 1908 and 1918. In 1914 the Louvre, Paris, bought a silver bowl (1912), subsequently known as the 'Louvre bowl'. It shows both the slightly low, bulbous profile and the use of discrete bands of decoration that are typical of his hollow-ware. In 1907, Jensen entered into a lifelong partnership with the painter Johan Rohde (1856-1935), who was responsible for several important designs, including the successful flatware pattern 'Acorn' (1915). Jensen designs are displayed at the Georg Jensen Museum in the company's main Copenhagen shop. "
112402,François-Thomas Germain,1721,1780,"French silversmith, part of a family of silversmiths, son of Thomas Germain (1674-1748). On the death of his father, he was allowed to take over his father's lodgings in the Louvre, Paris, and was appointed Sculpteur-Orfèvre du Roi. He completed items commissioned from Thomas Germain (e.g. lamp, 1744-54, for Ste Geneviève, Paris) and also modified earlier pieces by his father, for example a pair of tureens and stands (1726-28; Malibu, CA, Getty Museum), which have an inscription on the stands added by François-Thomas in 1764. He also continued to use his father's casting models. In 1765 Germain broke guild regulations by working with financiers to receive some debts owed to him, as he was only allowed to enter into partnerships with his fellow smiths. For this he was forced to resign his position and declare bankruptcy. He died out of the public eye in 1791, the last member of his distinguished family to serve as a royal smith. "

42219,Angeluccio,,,"Italian painter. He is the only known pupil of Claude Lorrain other than Claude's long-standing assistant Giandomenico Desiderii (c. 1622-after 1657). Pascoli, the only biographer to record him, claimed in his life of Claude that Angeluccio was Claude's most able student but had died young and was able to work little. Angeluccio appears to have lived in Rome and, like Claude, was exclusively a landscape painter. About 25 paintings and 35 drawings, all dated 1640-45, comprise his entire oeuvre. Claude's influence can be seen in such paintings as Landscape with Figures and Bridge (private collection). This is a composition with centrally placed foreground figures framed by trees in the middle ground, which in turn stand before a bridge and a distant vista, and was borrowed directly from such paintings by Claude as Pastoral Landscape (1644-45; Barnes Foundation, Merion). Although Angeluccio shared Claude's approach to landscape, he was not merely an imitator. His paintings form a coherent stylistic group of wooded landscapes, rich in foliage and undergrowth and characterized by a blue-green tonality, which indicates that he also embraced the tradition of landscape painting brought to Rome in the 17th century by Dutch and Flemish artists. The romanticism evoked by this blending of borrowed elements gives Angeluccio's works their distinguishing quality. His paintings frequently also contain rustic genre figures. Angeluccio's most frequent provider of figures was Michelangelo Cerquozzi. "

He became court painter for the Emperor Maximilian in Nuremberg, and - from 1503-04 - the Elector Frederick III (the Wise). From 1510 he became court painter of the Governor of the Netherlands, Margaret of Austria in Brussels. He painted mainly religious and mythological pictures and signed nearly all his works with a caduceus. Barbari's idiosyncratic facial and figural types influenced contemporary masters such as Albrecht Dürer, Lucas Cranach the Elder, Albrecht Altdorfer, Hans von Kulmbach and Jan Gossart."

He worked in Paris (c. 1508-20) together with his brothers Robert and Gilles de Gourmont; subsequently he was in Lyon (1522-26). His engravings have been identified with those of the monogrammist JG; this is confirmed by the portrait of Cardinal Charles de Bourbon (c. 1551), where this monogram is followed by the inscription 'ourmont fe', completing his name. Three of his plates bear the word Alion. His engraved work, executed with very fine and close lines, comprises c. 30 pieces, two of which, St Barbara and St Sebastian, are copies after Marcantonio Raimondi. There is also a portrait of Charles, Cardinal de Guise-Lorraine (1575) and several arabesque strips, which may be part of a collection published by the Gourmont family in Paris in 1546: Le Livre des moresques, intended for goldsmiths, engravers, painters and embroiderers.

11694,Augustin Hirschvogel,1503,1553,"German glass painter, etcher, cartographer and mathematician, part of a family of artists. They were Nuremberg's leading stained-glass painters during the late 15th century and the 16th. Veit Hirschvogel the Elder, the son of a glazier named Heinz (d. 1485), established the family workshop and became the city's official glazier. His son Veit Hirschvogel the Younger (1485-1553) succeeded him as official glazier, being succeeded in his turn by his son Sebald Hirschvogel (1517-89), who remained in the post for 33 years. The brothers of Veit the Younger, Hans Hirschvogel (d. 1516) and Augustin Hirschvogel, also joined the glass-painting workshop, but Augustin, the most talented of the family, left it in 1525 to pursue a varied career outside Nuremberg, producing many etchings and also innovations in cartography. It is supposed that the Viennese goldsmith Veit Hirschvogel (1543-74) was Augustin's son. Augustin Hirschvogel trained as a stained-glass painter in his father's workshop and remained there until his father's death in 1525. In that year Nuremberg accepted the Reformation, spelling the end of monumental stained-glass commissions. This must have profoundly reduced the production of the workshop, now run by his elder brother Veit, and may have forced Augustin to become more versatile. By 1530 he had established his own workshop but in 1531 formed a partnership with the Nuremberg potters Hanns Nickel (active c. 1530) and Oswald Reinhart (active c. 1530), presumably to share their kiln. This partnership, coupled with Johann Neudörfer's confusing comments about Hirschvogel in his Nachrichten (1547), formerly led to speculation about his having made a ceramic stove and pots in a classicizing Italianate style. It is more likely that the vessels made by Augustin and described in documents as in a Venetian style were glass, not earthenware. "

112394,Eugenio Quarti,1867,1929,"Italian cabinetmaker and interior designer. He was born into a family of carpenters and, at 14, was apprenticed to a cabinetmaker in Paris. When he returned to Italy in the late 1880s, he was already a highly-skilled craftsman. He spent a few weeks in Milan at the studio of Carlo Bugatti, whose exotic and extravagant designs had a lasting influence on him. After a few months, Quarti had established himself in a small workshop called Quarti-Casati. At the Antwerp World Exposition in 1894, he was awarded a silver medal as ""a designer of fanciful furniture in an arborizing style."" At the Turin exposition of 1898, he won the gold medal. His official successes reached a pinnacle at the Esposizione Internazionale d'Arte Decorativa (1906) in Milan, where he won the Premio Reale and a gold medal for a divan he submitted. As a successful furniture designer, he was able to expand his business in 1904, after which date he also took part in furnishing larger buildings. He received several major commissions to furnish whole interiors, notably for the Palazzo Castiglioni, Corso Venezia 47, Milan (1901-03), built by Giuseppe Sommaruga, with ironwork by Alessandro Mazzucotelli (1865-1938). Together they created the best Italian expression of floral Art Nouveau, inspired by, but not imitative of, northern models. After 1910 Quarti favoured light woods, particularly lime, to which he would add veneers and inlays made of other woods. He responded to changing taste, moved away from Art Nouveau, and employed his fine craftsmanship to create the more angular forms associated with Art Deco. By 1905, Quarti-Casati had taken on the proportions of a small industrial business with a rapidly expanding customer base. After Quart died in 1929, his son Mario Quarti (1901-1974) adapted the Quarti workshop to the more demanding and large-scale commissions required by an ever more varied and rich clientele. "

It was not until 1887, when he received a small inheritance, that he was able to devote himself to painting. He spent a year studying modelling and design at the École des Arts Décoratifs in Paris and then entered the studio of the French landscape painter Fernand Just Quignon (b. 1854) for six months in 1889. After setting in 1890 in Pont-Aven in Brittany, where he met the painters Maxime Maufra and Henry Moret, he produced such carefully executed works as the Green Rocks (1893; Geneva, Petit Palais). It was not until 1894, however, that he met Gauguin on the latter's return from Tahiti, and though he did not accept Gauguin's synthetist ideas the encounter led to a stronger structure and freer brushstrokes in his subsequent work. He exhibited with the Neo-Impressionists between 1891 and 1895. His views of Paris are famous. He travelled frequently in Normandy, along the Seine, on the cliff coast of Dieppe and in the Dordogne. He stayed often in Pontoise where he visited Gachet. In 1901 Loiseau had a large single exhibition at Durand-Ruel. "

36271,Francesco Primaticcio,1504,1570,"Primaticcio was the head of the First School of Fontainebleau, and a universal impresario - painter, sculptor, architect, interior decorator. He learned these arts under Giulio Romano in the Palazzo del Tè at Mantua, from 1525/6 until 1532, when he was summoned to France by François I and began to work at Fontainebleau, where he met Rosso. From 1540 until 1542 he was in Rome buying for François, and on his return he found that Rosso was dead and Cellini had arrived (Cellini later threatened to kill him 'like a dog'). With Niccolò dell'Abbate he worked on the (lost) decorations of the Galérie d'Ulysse at Fontainebleau, and in 1546 he was again in Rome to get casts made, including Michelangelo's Pietà in St Peter's, while in 1563 he revisited Bologna, his native town, and met Vasari there. There are works by him in Barnard Castle (Bowes Museum), Bologna, Chantilly, Florence (Uffizi), Glasgow, Montpellier, Paris (Louvre and Cluny Museum), Pittsburgh, and Toledo Ohio, but his main contribution is the combination of painted and high relief stucco decoration evolved at Fontainebleau and still partially preserved there. "
33589,Bernardo Bellotto,1721,1780,"Italian painter, nephew, pupil, and assistant of Canaletto (Antonio Canal) in Venice. At about the age of fourteen he entered the service of his uncle Canaletto as a student. In 1742 Bernardo left to spend some time in Rome, just as his uncle Antonio had done at the same age, and apparently with the same goal: to study architectural and topographical painting at the place where the best practitioners had lived, or at any rate where they had worked. A year later he returned to Venice, by way of Florence. In the archives of the Venetian guild Bellotto is mentioned for the last time in 1743. We can be certain that Bellotto worked closely together with his uncle during his last years in Venice. In a number of paintings of about 1740 from Canaletto's workshop Bellotto's hand can be recognized with a reasonable degree of certainty in stylistic idiosyncrasies which were to become increasingly characteristic of his work. Almost doubtlessly, other canvases were painted by Canaletto after composition drawings by Bellotto. As an independent artist, however, Bellotto comes most clearly to the fore in two pairs of paintings from 1744 and 1745, which represent the village of Gazzada near Varese and the ramparts of Turin, respectively. Even aside from the motifs, which are completely different from those of Canaletto, it is especially the use of colour that one notices: not the light, clear pastel colours of Canaletto's middle period, but rather saturated greens and browns, and a good deal of shadow, against skies which can be of a very cool blue. Bellotto left Italy for good in 1747, to spend the rest of his life working at various European courts, notably Dresden and Warsaw, where he died. He called himself Canaletto, and this caused confusion (perhaps deliberate) between his work and his uncle's, particularly in views of Venice. He worked in Dresden for eleven years as court painter to the elector-king August III of Saxony and Poland. He was commissioned by August III to paint three series of large-sized canvases - twenty-nine in all - with scenes of the cities of Dresden and Pirna and of the fortresses Sonnenstein and Königstein. These canvases, most of them almost two and a half metres wide, were to be hung in the royal painting gallery in the Stallhof. In addition he painted a similar series, though of more modest dimensions, for the courtier Count Brühl, and a number of even smaller ones for various other private individuals. It was in Dresden that Bellotto's style finally was fully developed. It is characterized by the greatest possible topographical precision, complete control of light and mathematical perspective, and a consequent pursuit of clarity and organization. Not surprisingly, Bellotto's work shows no trace of the virtuosity with which his uncle would dash figures and other details onto the canvas. His brushwork is unhurried and descriptive, almost severe, and in his use of colours he constantly seems to be seeking to reproduce precisely the hues he had observed in the open air. Yet the most remarkable feature of Bellotto's work is his handling of light. He seems not to be occupied with atmospheric perspective; an almost unreal clarity and calm pervades his canvases, and the link which has been suggested between these features and the ideals of the enlightened despots for whom he worked may not be far from the mark. In 1758 Bellotto fled from the violence of the Seven Years War to Vienna, where he entered the services of Empress Maria Theresia for three years. For her and her courtiers he also painted a series of large canvases with cityscapes and views of imperial and princely residences, but most of the canvases produced during this period were intended to embellish the imperial palaces. Perhaps this is why the views of residences are expressive of a taste for decor and theatre much more than the Dresden canvases. Toward the end of the war Bellotto returned to Dresden, the city he knew so well, by way of Munich. But there was no longer any place for court painters in the capital of Saxony. The city had suffered terribly, the prince was impoverished and in artistic matters the lay members of the recently founded Akademie held sway, who espoused classical ideals rather than the realism preferred by the royal house. Bellotto adjusted. He painted two more views, both of the ruins, one of which was actually purchased by the Akademie, and also produced architectural fantasies in classicist style. As soon as he could, however, Bellotto left Dresden, finding himself eventually in Warsaw, where he settled and continued to work from 1767 until his death in 1780. Here he was at the court of an enlightened prince once more, this time King Stanislaus Poniatowski. As August III had done in Dresden, this prince was attempting to create a modern Western European cultural climate in Poland, along Italian lines. Besides many palace decorations and a series of Roman townscapes Bellotto again painted in Warsaw a series of topographical views of the large size he had used earlier: twenty views of Warsaw itself and four of Wilanow Palace. Virtually the entire series decorates the 'Canaletto Hall' in Warsaw's Royal Palace. In marked contrast to Canaletto, who worked largely for the tourist market, virtually all Bellotto's paintings were intended for royal residences and galleries. It is very likely for this reason that, whereas Canaletto's oeuvre attracted a hoard of imitators and followers, Bellotto remained a relatively isolated figure in the history of art, whose work was only slowly discovered, recognized and distinguished from that of the other Canaletto in the course of the 20th century. Bellotto's style is distinguished from his uncle's by an almost Dutch interest in massed clouds, cast shadows, and rich foliage. His colouring is also generally more sombre, much of his work being characterized by a steely grey. The best collections of his work are in Dresden (Gemäldegalerie) and Warsaw (National Museum). In the rebuilding of Warsaw after the Second World War his pictures were used as guides, even in the reconstruction of architectural ornament. "

44508,Francis Danby,1793,1861,"Irish painter. He was a landowner's son and studied art at the Dublin Society. In 1813 he visited London, then worked in Bristol, initially on repetitious watercolours of local scenes: for example, View of Hotwells, the Avon Gorge (c. 1818; Bristol, Museum and Art Gallery). Around 1819 he entered the cultivated circle of George Cumberland (1754-1849) and the Rev. John Eagles (1783-1855). Danby's discovery of the 'poetry of nature' in local scenery and insignificant incident was influenced by the theories of Eagles, published as The Sketcher (1856), and, less directly, by those of William Wordsworth, who had been associated with Bristol earlier in the century. Danby's distinctive work began with the small panel paintings he produced for his Bristol audience. Boy Sailing a Little Boat (c.  1822; Bristol, Museum and Art Gallery) recalls the rustic scenes of William Collins and the Bristol artist Edward Villiers Rippingille, but Danby emphasized the effect of sun and shade rather than sentiment. Danby worked mainly in Bristol and London, but between 1829 and 1841, owing to financial and marital problems, he settled in Switzerland. He is remembered mainly for his bombastic apocalyptic paintings, which were a direct challenge to John Martin. However, his best works are now usually considered to be the romantic sunset landscapes of his later years, with their mood of melancholy and solemn serenity (Temple of Flora, Tate Gallery, London, 1840).

3590,Carlo Bugatti,1855,1940,"Italian designer, active also in France. His biography, based on the poorly documented family tradition, remains sketchy. His father, Giovanni Luigi Bugatti, was a decorative stone-carver. Carlo Bugatti registered at the Accademia di Brera in Milan in 1875 and is said later to have been at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris. He painted and showed an interest in architecture, producing designs for buildings and elements of interior architecture at several points in his career, although no structures designed by him are recorded as having been executed. In 1880 he returned to Milan, where he lived for approximately 25 years. The first clear visual evidence of Bugatti's activities as a furniture designer and manufacturer is contained in some illustrations related to the display of his work at the Italian Exhibition at Earl's Court, London, in 1888. Bugatti's furniture is self-consciously original in design, though sources for its style can be found in the Islamic and Japanese decorative traditions and Romanesque architecture.  Elaborate fringes and tassels often decorate his pieces. Circles, round arches and, later, curving planes are usually encountered in his furniture designs. Once his formal vocabulary was established, Bugatti produced a varied series of works using a limited number of motifs. A stylistic progression is observable in his designs towards unified, plastic forms, but the precise chronology of this development is not clear, and it seems that early designs continued to be manufactured over a long period. About 1904, Bugatti and his family moved to Paris. He sold his Milanese furniture-making shop, but Italian firms made furniture after his designs or in his style for some years after his departure. In France, he turned his attention primarily to designing silver pieces, often incorporating fantastic human and animal forms. Some furniture designed by Bugatti was produced in France but probably not in large quantity. He also made plaster models for interior architectural schemes, but they seem not to have been realized. After 1910 he seems to have lived essentially in retirement in Pierrefonds, Oise, occasionally painting, but virtually ceasing his design activities. In 1937 he moved to Molsheim, Alsace, to be near his son Ettore. Carlo Bugatti's sons achieved illustrious careers of their own. Rembrandt Bugatti (1884-1916) became a sculptor, and Ettore Bugatti (1881-1947) manufactured luxurious automobiles and racing cars. "

36119,Samuel Palmer,1805,1881,"English landscape painter and etcher. He showed a precocious talent and exhibited landscape drawings at the Royal Academy when he was 14. In 1822 he met Linnell, who introduced him to William Blake in 1824. Palmer had had visionary experiences from childhood and the effect of Blake upon him was to intensify an inherent mystical bent. In 1826 he moved to Shoreham, near Sevenoaks, Kent, where he was the central figure of the group of artists known as the Ancients and produced what are now his most famous works - landscapes charged with a sense of pantheistic fecundity and other-worldly beauty. In about 1832 what he called his 'primitive and infantine feeling' for landscape began to fade, and after returning to London in 1835, marrying Linnell's daughter in 1837, and spending a two-year honeymoon in Italy, the break with his visionary manner was complete. His later paintings were in a much more conventional topographical or pastoral mode, highly-wrought and often sentimental in feeling. In his etchings, however, something of his early genius remained; at his death he was working on an edition of Virgil's Eclogues, translated and illustrated by himself. His early work was virtually forgotten until the 1920s, but it has subsequently influenced modern romantic landscape artists such as Paul Nash and Graham Sutherland. "

7212,Daniel Dumonstier,1574,1646,"Dumonstier (also spelt Du Monstier; Dumontier; Dumoustier; Du Moustier] was a French family of artists. At least 11 artists of this name are known, working variously as painters, draughtsmen, designers, goldsmiths and sculptors, and active from the 16th century to the 18th. The exact relationships of some family members are difficult to determine; these include Cosme Dumonstier I (d. 1552), a goldsmith known to have worked for Rouen Cathedral; Étienne Dumonstier I (fl. Rouen, c. 1501), an illuminator working at the château of Gaillon for Cardinal Georges d'Amboise; Cardin (or Carentin) Dumonstier, a sculptor mentioned in the accounts of the Bâtiments du Roi from 1540 to 1550; and Charles Dumonstier, active in the mid-18th century as a painter and engraver: his works include portraits of Louis XV and Marie Leczinska (Paris, Louvre). The main branch of the family began with the painter and illuminator Jean Dumonstier (d. c. 1535), whose son Geoffroy Dumonstier (c. 1510-1573) followed his profession. Another son, Meston Dumonstier (fl. c. 1535), was a goldsmith in Rouen. Geoffroy's sons Étienne Dumonstier II (c. 1540-1603), Pierre Dumonstier I and Cosme Dumonstier II (c. 1545-1605), as well as Cosme and Etienne's respective sons, Daniel Dumonstier and Pierre Dumonstier II (c. 1585-1656), are best known as portrait draughtsmen working for the French court. Daniel's sons Etienne III and Nicolas were also artists. The last member of this branch was Nicolas's son Louis Dumonstier (b. 1641), a mediocre reproductive engraver. Daniel Dumonstier was a painter and draughtsman. In 1601 he was appointed painter to the Dauphin (later Louis XIII) and in 1603 Peintre et Valet de Chambre to Henry IV. He enjoyed great favour at court; in 1622 he was granted accommodation in the Louvre, and in 1626 he was appointed Peintre et Valet de Chambre to Gaston, Duc d'Orléans, the King's brother. His witty and satirical spirit brought him the friendship of men of letters such as François de Malherbe, Nicolas-Claude Fabri de Peiresc and Gédéon Tallemant des Réaux. His collection of natural history curiosities, medals, objets d'art, books and manuscripts was famous: Jules, Cardinal Mazarin, acquired some of it after his death, while another part of it, judged 'licentious and indecorous', was destroyed on the orders of Anne of Austria.

He seems to have married about the same year. On 31 August 1464 he was granted a house on a six-year lease by the chapter of Bourges Cathedral, but the decision must have been reversed, because he was installed in another house in 1465. By 1471 he had built a house on a plot of land granted to him in 1467 by the chapter of St Pierre de Puellier, Bourges, and he lived there until 1493, when it was occupied by his son Philibert. Jean then retired to a house he owned on the outskirts of Bourges, where he continued to work at a reduced pace. He was employed by Charles I, Duke of Savoy, at his court at Chambéry between 1486 and 1489. Jean Colombe is best known for his work in Les Très Riches Heures du Duc de Berry, made by the Limbourg brothers. He executed the image for the month of November, completed the Limbourg brothers' design for September, and retouched other images. "

Hayter was awarded the British Institution's premium for history painting for the Prophet Ezra (1815; Downton Castle, Herefordshire), purchased by Richard Payne Knight. Encouraged by his patron, John Russell, 6th Duke of Bedford, he travelled to Italy to study in 1816, gaining election as an honorary member of the Accademia di S Luca in Florence. Returning to London in 1818, Hayter practised as a portrait painter in oils and history painter and occasionally acted as an art dealer. Dubbed 'The Phoenix' by William Beckford, Hayter showed a pomposity that irritated his fellow artists, but he mixed freely with many aristocratic families. His unconventional domestic life (separated from his wife, he lived openly with his mistress) set him apart from official Academy circles: he was never elected to the Royal Academy. "

33874,Annibale Carracci,1560,1609,"The Carracci was a family of Bolognese painters, the brothers Agostino (1557-1602) and Annibale (1560-1609) and their cousin Lodovico (1555-1619), who were prominent figures at the end of the 16th century in the movement against the prevailing Mannerist artificiality of Italian painting. They worked together early in their careers, and it is not easy to distinguish their shares in, for example, the cycle of frescos in the Palazzo Fava in Bologna (c.1583-84). In the early 1580s they opened a private teaching academy, which soon became a center for progressive art. It was originally called the Accademia dei Desiderosi ('Desiderosi' meaning 'desirous of fame and learning'), but later changed its name to Academia degli Incamminati (Academy of the Progressives). In their teaching they laid special emphasis on drawing from the life (all three were outstanding graphic artists) and clear draughtsmanship became a quality particularly associated with artists of the Bolognese School, notably Domenichino and Reni, two of the leading members of the following generation who trained with the Carracci. They continued working in close relationship until 1595, when Annibale, who was by far the greatest artist of the family, was called to Rome by Cardinal Odoardo Farnese to carry out his masterpiece, the decoration of the Farnese Gallery in the cardinal's family palace. He first decorated a small room called the Camerino with stories of Hercules, and in 1597 undertook the ceiling of the larger gallery, where the theme was The Loves of the Gods, or, as Bellori described it, ""human love governed by Celestial love"". Although the ceiling is rich in the interplay of various illusionistic elements, it retains fundamentally the self-contained and unambiguous character of High Renaissance decoration, drawing inspiration from Michelangelo's Sistine Ceiling and Raphael's frescos in the Vatican Loggie and the Farnesina. The full untrammelled stream of Baroque illusionism was still to come in the work of Cortona and Lanfranco, but Annibale's decoration was one of the foundations of their style. Throughout the 17th and 18th centuries the Farnese Ceiling was ranked alongside the Sistine Ceiling and Raphael's frescos in the Vatican Stanze as one of the supreme masterpieces of painting. It was enormously influential, not only as a pattern book of heroic figure design, but also as a model of technical procedure; Annibale made hundreds of drawings for the ceiling, and until the age of Romanticism such elaborate preparatory work became accepted as a fundamental part of composing any ambitious history painting. In this sense, Annibale exercised a more profound influence than his great contemporary Caravaggio, for the latter never worked in fresco, which was still regarded as the greatest test of a painter's ability and the most suitable vehicle for painting in the Grand Manner. Annibale's other works in Rome also had great significance in the history of painting. Pictures such as Domine, Quo Vadis? (National Gallery, London, c.1602) reveal a striking economy in figure composition and a force and precision of gesture that had a profound influence on Poussin and through him on the whole language of gesture in painting. He developed landscape painting along similar lines, and is regarded as the father of ideal landscape, in which he was followed by Domenichino (his favorite pupil), Claude, and Poussin. The Flight into Egypt (Doria Gallery, Rome, c.1604) is Annibale's masterpiece in this genre. In his last years Annibale was overcome by melancholia and gave up painting almost entirely after 1606. When he died he was buried accordingly to his wished near Raphael in the Pantheon. It is a measure of his achievement that artists as great and diverse as Bernini, Poussin and Rubens found so much to admire and praise in his work. Annibale's art also had a less formal side that comes out in his caricatures (he is generally credited with inventing the form) and in his early genre paintings, which are remarkable for their lively observation and free handling (The Butcher's Shop, Christ Church, Oxford).

Agostino assisted Annibale in the Farnese Gallery from 1597 to 1600, but he was important mainly as a teacher and engraver. His systematic anatomical studies were engraved after his death and were used for nearly two centuries as teaching aids. He spent the last two years in Parma, where he did his own ""Farnese Ceiling"", decorating a ceiling in the Palazzo del Giardino with mythological scenes for Duke Ranuccio Farnese. It shows a meticulous but somewhat spiritless version of his brother's lively Classicism.

Ludovico left Bologna only for brief periods and directed the Carracci academy by himself after his cousins had gone to Rome. His work is uneven and highly personal. Painterly and expressive considerations always outweigh those of stability and calm Classicism in his work, and at its best there is a passionate and poetic quality indicative of his preference for Tintoretto and Jacopo Bassano. His most fruitful period was 1585-95, but near the end of his career he still produced remarkable paintings of an almost Expressionist force, such as the Christ Crucified above Figures in Limbo (Sta Francesco Romana, Ferrara, 1614). The Caracci fell from grace in the 19th century along with all the other Bolognese painters, who were one of Ruskin's pet hates and whom he considered (1847) had ""no single virtue, no color, no drawing, no character, no history, no thought"". They were saddled with the label ""eclectic"" and thought to be ponderous and lacking in originality. Their full rehabilitation had to wait until the second half of the 20th century (the great Carracci exhibition held in Bologna in 1956 was a notable event), but Annibale has now regained his place as one of the giants of Italian painting. Agostino's illegitimate son Antonio (1589?-1618) was the only offspring of the three Carracci. He had a considerable reputation as an artist in his day, but after his early death was virtually forgotten, and it is only recently that his work has been reconsidered. "

He was a much livelier artist than many Neoclassical sculptors, however, and although his mature work has impressive clarity of form, it also possesses warmth and vitality. In Rome he was best known for his spirited sketches in clay and terracotta, but after his return to Sweden he was mainly a portraitist. He was court sculptor to Gustavus III and his most important work is a bronze statue of the king (1790-1808) in front of the Royal Palace in Stockholm. Sergel was a prolific draughtsman, many of his drawings being Romantic in spirit, in a style similar to those of Fuseli, who was a friend during his period in Rome. "

Volpato's main contribution to the development of Neoclassical sculpture consisted in establishing and running a porcelain factory in Rome from 1786.Pope Pius VI had granted him the privilege of reproducing in porcelain the classical sculptures in the Vatican Museums.

Fearnley spent much of his life travelling. In Norway in the summer of 1826 he met Johan Christian Clausen Dahl, with whom he later studied in Dresden (1829-30), learning especially to observe nature. After two years in Munich (1830-32), Fearnley's style was also influenced by the local school of landscape painters, which stressed more atmospheric effects. "

42223,Cristofano Allori,1577,1621,"Alessandro Allori (1535-1607), Florentine painter, the pupil and adopted son of Bronzino. An early visit to Rome added the influence of late Michelangelo paintings to that of his master's courtly Mannerism. The Pearl Fishers (Studiolo of Francesco I, Palazzo Vecchio, Florence, c.1570) is generally considered his masterpiece; playful and full of artifice, it combines nude figures obviously drawn from Michelangelo with Bronzino's svelteness and enamelled colouring. He was one of the last notable exponents of Mannerism, painting in a style that had become outmoded by the time of his death. His son Cristofano (1577-1621) was one of the leading Florentine painters of his period, working in a style that was more naturalistic and Baroque than that of his father. He is remembered primarily for one work, Judith with the Head of Holofernes (c. 1615, Pitti, Florence, and other versions), in which his femme fatale mistress is portrayed as Judith and he has depicted his own features in Holofernes' severed head. In the 18th and 19th centuries it was one of the most famous paintings in Italy. The Ashmolean Museum in Oxford possesses portraits by both Alessandro and Cristofano Allori. "

His technique of painting in thin layers on a white ground links him tenuously with the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, but his pretty and undemandingly trivial subject matter, his use of a middle tone, and traditional 18th-century systems of composition, later incurred their particular displeasure and rejection. He became an Associate of the Royal Academy in 1815, and, following the success of his The Fight Interrupted in 1816, a Royal Academician. He designed the first penny post envelope issued by Rowland Hill in 1840. "

53520,Johan Christian Clausen Dahl,1788,1857,"Norwegian painter, often called the discoverer of the Norwegian landscape. From 1824 until his death he was a professor at the Academy of Dresden, where he was a friend of Friedrich. The landscapes of Ruisdael were another influence on his Romantic outlook. Through his deep feeling for the grandeur of the landscape of his native country he was a pioneer of the new spirit of nationalism that characterized much Norwegian art in the 19th century. "
36973,Giovanni Domenico Tiepolo,1727,1804,"Giovanni Domenico (Giandomenico) Tiepolo was the son of Giovanni Battista Tiepolo, the greatest Italian painter of the 18th century. His mother was Cecilia Guardi, the sister of the painter Guardi brothers. The gifted and clever son of a great artist, Giandomenico Tiepolo spent many years learning by working alongside his father. Giambattista was so convinced of his son's talent that he involved him in the major commissions he undertook at the height of his own powers, and Giandomenico went with him to Würzburg, Vicenza, Stra, and Madrid. It becomes progressively easier to pick out Giandomenico's contributions to the works completed in these years, as during this time he was gradually acquiring his own personal style. This was substantially different (at least in the choice of subject matter) from his father's. Giandomenico's temperament emerged most effectively in the frescos he painted for the guest lodge at Villa Valmarana near Vicenza (1757). They are imbued with a strong sense of realism, if still elegant and playful. Giandomenico had a marked preference for scenes from contemporary life. He viewed life always from a somewhat ironic perspective (although this was usually quite gentle, he could on occasion become savage). This was true of him both as a painter and as an engraver. At the same time he never broke away fully from his father's style. In particular, Giandomenico worked very closely with his aged father during their stay in Spain (1762-70). The paintings he and his father produced in Madrid were to be a fundamental influence on Goya at the start of his own career. After his return to Italy, Giandomenico pursued important decorative programs in Venice, Brescia, and Genoa. His painting gradually became tinged with the feeling that it was the end of an epoch. This translated as a lightness of touch and a latent melancholy in the frescos he painted in his family's own villa. These were painted during the last decade of the eighteenth century and are now in the Ca' Rezzonico. Giandomenico is noteworthy also for his etchings, especially the twenty-two variations on the theme of the Flight into Egypt (1753). "

Soprani wrote that Roccatagliata fashioned models used by the aged Tintoretto to plot his compositions; this would place Roccatagliata in Venice by the mid-1580s. He is first documented, however, on 31 January 1593, when he was commissioned to make the bronze statuettes of St George and St Stephen, still on the entrance to the balustrade across the choir of San Giorgio Maggiore. This church was the centre of the artist's activity in the 1590s: twenty-two sconces in the form of putti were commissioned in 1594, another six in 1595, and two large candelabra, cast by Cesare Groppo (active c. 1596) and Giovanni Alberghetti (active c. 1600) in 1598. The next known date in his career is 1633, the date on the antependium depicting the Allegory of the Redemption in San Moise in Venice. Signed by Nicolò and Sebastiano (?his son), the relief was cast by Jean Chenet (active c. 1633) and Marin Feron. Numerous small bronzes of vastly varying quality have been attributed to Roccatagliata; if only a fraction of the music-making angels attributed to him actually came from his shop, it must have been a flourishing enterprise. Certainly by him are a seated Virgin and Child (Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, as well as Adam and Eve and two music-making putti (Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna). "

33858,Antonio Canova,1757,1822,"Italian sculptor. Called ""the supreme minister of beauty"" and ""a unique and truly divine man"" by contemporaries, Antonio Canova was considered the greatest sculptor of his time. He was brought up as a mason and already had his own studio, in Venice, by 1774. He became the most famous Neoclassical sculptor whose international reputation surpassed even those of Flaxman, Thorvaldsen and Gibson. His early work is still very much in the 18th- century tradition, and reminiscent of French portrait sculpture (e.g. Houdon) in its liveliness, but by 1779 he had been converted to Neoclassical theory and this was confirmed by his visit to Rome and Naples in 1780 and his residence in Rome from 1781. Despite his lasting reputation as a champion of Neoclassicism, Canova's earliest works displayed a late Baroque or Rococo sensibility that was appealing to his first patrons, nobility from his native Venice. During his first and second visits to Rome in 1779 and 1781, Canova reached a turning point. He studied antiquities, visited the grand studios of the Roman restorers Bartolomeo Cavaceppi and Francesco Antonio Franzoni, and came under the influence of the English Neoclassicist Gavin Hamilton. In a competition organized by the Venetian aristocrat Don Abbondio Rezzonico, Canova produced his statuette of Apollo Crowning Himself, a work inspired by ancient art of a physically idealized and emotionally detached figure. This work came to define the Neoclassical style. The success of the Apollo enabled the young sculptor to obtain a block of marble for his next work on a large scale,  Theseus and the Minotaur, which established his reputation. In 1782 he received his first major commission, the Monument to Pope Clement XIV (1782-7, Rome, SS. Apostoli), followed by that to Clement XIII (1787-92, St Peter's). The French invasion caused him to go to Vienna in 1797, and there he got the commission for the Monument to Maria Christina in the Augustinerkirche. Is 1802, pressed by the Vatican, he accepted Napoleon's invitation to Paris; although he did not approve of the French looting of works of art from Italy he became an admirer of Napoleon and made a bust of him from life. This was followed by many others and in the years 1806-08 he began several, including an equestrian bronze for Naples and two gigantic standing figures of the Emperor, stark naked. One of these, in bronze, is in Milan (Brera); the other, in marble, is now in the Wellington Museum, London - the restored Bourbons, having no use for it, sold it off cheaply to the British Government, which presented it to Wellington. In 1807 he also began (but abandoned) a Nelson Monument. Canova's best-known work is the portrait of Napoleon's sister, Paolina Bonaparte Borghese as Venus (1808, Rome, Borghese), one of several statues of members of Napoleon's family based on classical prototypes. Paolina's portrait can be considered a marble equivalent to David's Madame Récamier. In 1815, after the fall of Napoleon, Canova was sent by the Pope to Paris to try to secure the return of the works looted by the French. With English help, he succeeded in large measure and he visited London on his way home. There he studied the Elgin Marbles, bought after much controversy for the British Museum in 1816, but they had little effect, at that stage in his career, upon the fundamentally Roman (rather than Greek) basis of his art. For his part in securing the return of the Italian treasures the Pope created him Marchese d'Ischia. In 1817 he transformed his equestrian Napoleon, destined for Naples, into Charles III Bourbon, and in the same year he adapted his colossal Religion into a smaller figure for a Brownlow Monument in Belton Lincolnshire, where it is said to represent Protestant Faith. Two years later, at the expense of George III, he made the Monument to the Stuarts, now in St Peter's, Rome. In 1820 he made a Washington for North Carolina (now destroyed). He seems to have been an extremely kind and generous man, spending his large fortune freely in helping young students and sending patrons to struggling sculptors. He seems to have made innovations in pointing, but his reliance on such mechanical methods makes his handling somewhat insensitive: to counteract this he often spent much time on finishing himself. There is a large collection of casts of his works in his native village, Possagno, near Treviso. "

5215,Edward William Cooke,1811,1880,"English landscape and marine painter, and gardener, the second of the eleven children of George Cooke, engraver and print publisher, and his wife, Elizabeth Harriet Eglinton (1785-1882). He was educated at Grove House School, Woodford, Essex, before receiving artistic training in the studios of his father, uncle, and family friends, during which he became deeply versed in works of the early nineteenth-century landscapists. He showed outstanding talent as a draughtsman. At the age of nine he made drawings for the Encyclopedia of Plants (1820) by the Scottish horticulturalist John Claudius Loudon, and at fourteen he helped Clarkson Stanfield with some of his commissions. In March 1828 the first four plates were published of his Fifty Plates of Shipping and Craft, a series of beautifully drawn and engraved studies of fishing boats and barges, beach scenes and harbours. He began painting in oils in 1833, took formal lessons from James Stark in 1834 and first exhibited at the Royal Academy and British Institution in 1835, by which time his style was essentially formed. Cooke and several of his father's other pupils moved in the circle of Richard Parkes Bonington, whose watercolour style Cooke emulated. He showed a single-minded devotion to minutely observed portraits of smaller working craft, recording their appearance in every country he visited; his travels abroad included tours of France from 1833, the Netherlands from 1837, western Italy from 1845-46, Venice from 1850, Sweden and Denmark in 1853, Spain in 1861, and Egypt in 1874. He returned to the Netherlands regularly, studying the effects of the coastal landscape and light, as well as the works of the country's Old Masters, resulting in highly successful paintings. He also had serious natural history and geological interests, being a Fellow of the Linnean Society, Fellow of the Geological Society and Fellow of the Zoological Society, and of the Society of Antiquaries. In the 1840s he helped his friend, the horticulturist, James Bateman fit out and design the gardens at Biddulph Grange in Staffordshire, in particular the orchids and rhododendrons. His geological interests in particular led to his election as Fellow of the Royal Society in 1863 and he became a Royal Academician the following year. "

37362,Frank Lloyd Wright,1867,1959,"American architect, interior designer and author. Wright is internationally recognized as one of the most important figures in 20th-century architecture. However, unlike other architects whose success and reputation are measured in part by the dispersal of their ideals into the everyday landscape, Wright remained an individualist who made only a slight impact on the evolution of 20th-century architecture. Instead, his fame is derived from his intuitive ability to mould space within an environment and within space itself. He is best known for his ""Prairie style"" homes, efficient office buildings, and innovative furniture and chinaware designs. Frank Lloyd Wright began his practice with Louis Henry Sullivan, the first American Art Nouveau architect, and was one of the most productive and revolutionary American architects at that time. Contemporary of Belgian Art Nouveau designers Henry van de Velde and Victor Horta, he was influenced by the British Arts and Crafts Movement, as he worked for architectural and social emancipation. In 1894, he built his personal house and his workshop in Oak Park, Chicago. Fascinated by Japanese Art, he visited Japan in 1905. He later began designing and building his ""Prairies Houses"", an original architectural project, where he elaborated new concepts for the shape of the buildings and their relationship to their surrounding environment. In 1909 he travelled in Europe, where he was inspired by European architects. Back in the US in 1911, he founded the Wisconsin School of Architecture in his home. In 1913, he was back in Japan to finalize the contract for the  Imperial Hotel. In 1915, he opened an office in Tokyo, where his extended stay proved a turning point in his work. After his return to Chicago, he published several essays, including ""Modern Architecture"" (1931), and gave lectures at the university. Up till 1940, he worked chiefly as a teacher and theoretician, after which he again accepted numerous commissions. His most renowned works of the 1930s were the year-round weekend house, Fallingwater (1934-37) at Bear Run, in southwestern Pennsylvania, and the  S. C. Johnson & Co. Administration Building (1936-39) in Racine, Wisconsin. In his late period, he designed the Guggenheim Museum in New York (design 1943, construction 1956-59). The works of Frank Lloyd Wright are the result of pure functionalism concepts, where the form follows the function. He created simple and linear forms, fluid spatial transitions, intersecting planes and surfaces. He designed low buildings of stone and wood, connecting the inside with the outside of the house by combining terraces, water basins, gardens. The way of life had to coincide with the objects, furniture and architecture in an appropriate environment, near nature. "

4238,Valerio Castello,1624,1659,"Painter and draughtsman, son of the painter Bernardo Castello and the nephew of Giovanni Battista Castello. He was one of the leading Ligurian painters of the 17th century, whose art developed from a continuous and passionate study of a wide range of sources. His paintings of mythological and religious subjects unite an elegant figure style with an interest in dramatic and violent compositions; his touch is spontaneous and his palette vibrant with reds and pinks, blues and yellows. His brilliant decorative frescoes introduced the splendour of the High Baroque to Genoese painters. He was well known for his rapid oil sketches, with light and lively brushwork, which anticipate aspects of the Rococo. His lively frescoes of glowing colour and dramatic illusionism in various Genoese palaces made him most famous. His style united elegant figures with dramatic, violent compositions composed of spontaneous brushwork and vibrant colours. Few of his paintings are dated or datable, and his stylistic development remains highly controversial. "

37270,Benjamin West,1738,1820,"American-born painter of historical, religious, and mythological subjects who had a profound influence on the development of historical painting in Britain. He was historical painter to George III (1772-1801), a founder of the Royal Academy (1768), and in 1792 he succeeded Sir Joshua Reynolds as its president. As a young man, West showed precocious artistic talent and was sent to Philadelphia in 1756 to study painting. At 20 years of age he was a successful portraitist in New York City and in 1760, through the assistance of friends, he sailed for Italy, where Neoclassicism was rapidly gaining ground. West visited most of the leading art cities of Italy and in 1763 went to London, where he set up as a portrait painter. His subsequent patronage by George III and the assurance of financial support from the crown absolved him of the necessity to continue to earn a living through portraiture. In London he soon became intimate with Sir Joshua Reynolds and gained widespread popularity. The Death of General Wolfe (c. 1771; several versions exist), one of his best-known and - at the time - most controversial works, made a noteworthy concession to realism in its use of modern dress rather than antique drapery to depict a contemporary historical event within a classical composition. It was considered by many academicians to be an affront to the art of history painting, but ultimately it was a popular success and won Reynolds' approval. Though loyal to America, West retained the king's friendship and patronage until 1801. In 1802 he visited Paris and exhibited his final sketch for Death on the Pale Horse (c. 1802; several versions exist), which anticipated developments in French Romantic painting. He never returned to the United States, but through such pupils as Washington Allston, Gilbert Stuart, Charles Willson Peale, and John Singleton Copley, he exerted considerable influence on the development of art in that country during the first decades of the 19th century.

Among his earliest works is the Triumph of St Catherine and All Saints (Rome, Santa Caterina a Magnanapoli), which clearly shows the influence of Emilian painting, particularly that of Reni. Another early canvas is St Silvestro Shows Constantine Portraits of SS Peter and Paul (Rome, Santa Croce in Gerusalemme). In 1680 Garzi was appointed Regent of the Congregazione dei Virtuosi al Pantheon, and in 1682 he became Principe of the Accademia di San Luca, of which he had been a member since 1670. In the early 1680s he contributed to the frescoed decoration of the vault of San Carlo al Corso, where his works included an Allegory of Faith. This was influenced by Giovanni Lanfranco's decoration in Sant'Andrea della Valle, as was his fresco depicting the Glory of the Eternal Father (1686; Santa Maria del Popolo, Cappella Cybo). Garzi painted easel pictures, but he is best known for his monumental works. His fresco decorations can be seen in a number of churches in Rome and Naples. While always retaining his commitment to classicism, Garzi modified his style throughout his career in response to the prominent masters of the day, reflecting the influence of Luca Giordano and Francesco Solimena in about 1697 and his awareness of Carlo Maratti's late Baroque manner in the early 1710s.

56626,Jacques Rigaud,1681,1754,"French engraver and designer. He is often confused by biographers with his brother Jean-Baptiste (active 1750s). The son of an apothecary, he began his career in Marseille, although little is known of his training and early life. His earliest dated drawing is a large and panoramic View of Toulon During the Siege of 1707, executed when the artist was twenty-six years old; the drawing, which was also reproduced as an engraving, is today in the Musée du Vieux Toulon. Rigaud came to be best known as a printmaker, with an oeuvre of around two hundred prints. Until 1720 he worked in Marseille and elsewhere in Provence, creating a number of engravings. After 1720 he settled in Paris, where he worked as a draughtsman and printseller. Rigaud became known in particular for his drawings of views of Paris and other French cities, châteaux and gardens, most of which were published as sets of engravings. Rigaud's most important work, the series of Maisons Royales de France - numbering 138 prints in total - was eventually completed by his brother. In February 1733 Rigaud travelled to London. He worked in England for about a year and a half, mainly in London, where he produced views of the Royal residences and parks, including St. James's Park, Hampton Court and Richmond. He also worked for a number of aristocratic and noble patrons, producing views of Stowe for Lord Cobham and the garden at Chiswick House for Lord Burlington, as well as views of Claremont for the Duke of Newcastle.

25021,Abraham Storck,1630,1715,"Painter, member of a family of Dutch painters. No paintings are known by the Amsterdam painter Jan Jansz. Sturck, who later changed his name to Sturckenburch, but he had three sons, all painters, who used the name Sturckenburch until c. 1688, later calling themselves Storck or Sturck. There are no surviving works by the eldest son, Johannes (c. 1630-1673). Abraham Storck, the youngest, was the best known of the three artists. He was a versatile artist, renowned for his marine paintings, topographical views and Italianate harbour scenes. His brother Jacobus Storck painted similar subjects, but his works are fewer and less accomplished. Both brothers' pictures are mainly of a modest size and painted on canvas more often than on panel. Abraham trained and worked with his father and became a member of the Guild of St Luke in Amsterdam. In 1694 he married Neeltje Pieters van Meyservelt, a surgeon's widow. His river and coastal scenes were greatly influenced by Ludolf Bakhuysen in the pictorial treatment of sky and water, as, for example, in the Shipping Scene (Dublin, National Gallery) and the Roads of Enkhuizen (Amsterdam, Rijksmuseum, 1521). Abraham also absorbed influences from other well-known Amsterdam marine painters, notably Willem van de Velde the Younger and Jan Abrahamsz. Beerstraten. The Beerstraten and Storck families were close friends and distantly related by marriage. In his paintings of sea battles Abraham emulated Jan Beerstraten's somewhat crowded and agitated compositions. "

His talents were soon recognized and in 1736 he was sent to Paris to engrave some plates after Rigaud. Most of Wille's early art was in the genre of portrait engraving. By 1750, however, Wille had established himself as a leading engraver of historical and genre subjects, particularly after the designs of contemporary Dutch and German painters. Wille's unsurpassed ability to render form and texture earned him many honours. During his career he was awarded the lucrative titles of Engraver to the King of France, Engraver to the Emperor of Germany and Engraver to the King of Denmark. He was elected an Academician of the French Academy in 1761 and was also a member of the Academies of Dresden, Berlin, Augsburg, Vienna and Rouen. As the eighteenth century drew to a close the changing French political climate was not kind to Wille. Like many persons associated with French royalty, Wille lost his property and much of his possessions during the French Revolution. Failing eyesight also contributed to his poverty. His last engraving bears the date of 1790. "

He gave up painting professionally on his return to London, but continued to exhibit at the Royal Academy, 1784-88, and in 1798. There are six of his Corot-like landscapes in the National Museum of Wales at Cardiff. "

He trained under Robert West (active 1735-1770) at the Dublin Society's Drawing School, after which he moved to London in the early 1760s. There his skillfully executed pastel portraits attracted a large number of commissions from Irish and English sitters. Among his portraits of the royal family is that of Queen Charlotte (1769; Kupferstichkabinett, Berlin); many others are in the British Royal Collection. In 1779 Hamilton travelled to Italy, where he soon attracted an impressive array of British patrons. These included George John, 2nd Earl Spencer (examples at Althorp House, Northants); Lady Hannah Cowper, for whom he made an oval portrait in pastel: Countess Cowper (c. 1787; Firle Place, E. Sussex); and the exiled Stuart royal family, for example the portraits in oil of Charles Edward Stuart (c. 1785; Central Museum and Art Gallery, Dundee; National Portrait Gallery, Edinburgh).
 
In Italy his style became more rigorously Neo-Classical; his subject matter extended to history painting as well as portraiture and he began to experiment more frequently in oil paint. However, he continued to work in pastel producing handsome portraits of the 4th Earl of Guilford (National Gallery of Art, Washington), Jonas Langford Brooke (private collection), and, his most famous work showing Canova in his studio (Victoria and Albert Museum, London). In 1791 Hamilton returned to Dublin, where he died. "

36695,Paul Signac,1863,1935,"French painter, printmaker and writer. He came from a well-to-do family of shopkeepers. A visit to the exhibition of Claude Monet's works organized by Georges Charpentier at the offices of La Vie moderne in 1880 decided him on an artistic career and encouraged him to try painting out of doors. His early works, landscapes or still-lifes of 1882-83 (Still-life, 1883; Berlin, Neue Nationalgalerie)show an Impressionist influence, particularly that of Monet and Alfred Sisley. In 1883 Signac took courses given by the Prix de Rome winner Jean-Baptiste Bin (1825-c. 1890), but they had little effect on his style. Such suburban Paris landscapes as The Gennevilliers Road (1883; Paris, Musée d'Orsay) place his works in a world of modern images comparable to those of Jean François Rafaëlli in which factory chimneys, hoardings and etiolated trees abound. Already a friend of Henri Rivière, Signac soon met Armand Guillaumin, who provided important encouragement. In 1884 he was a founder-member of the Salon des Indépendants, where he met Georges Seurat who that year was exhibiting Bathers at Asnières (1884; London, National Gallery). In this painting Seurat had already begun to apply principles of divisionism (although not yet the dot-like brushstroke), while Signac was still practicing an orthodox form of Impressionism. With Georges Seurat Signac developed an exact mathematical system of applying dots of colour, which they called Pointillism. He traveled extensively along the European coast painting landscapes and seascapes; in his later years he painted street scenes of Paris and other cities. He was a master of watercolour, in which he achieved great brilliance of colour and a free, spontaneous style. His work had a great influence on Henri Matisse. "
7121,Jacques Dubois,1688,1763,"French cabinetmaker. He was a descendant of a family of French ébénistes, probably learned the craft in the workshop of his half-brother, Nöel Gérard, an important cabinetmaker and dealer of the 1720s and 1730s. He was an independent workman before becoming a maitre-ébéniste in 1742 and a juror of his guild from 1752 to 1754. He was an exacting and talented cabinetmaker with a cosmopolitan clientele, specializing in luxury items decorated with Japanese lacquer and marquetry. His pieces were often sober, and this complemented the power, beauty and quality of his vigorous and exuberant bronzes with their opposing Rococo curves in the Louis XV style. His stamped works include a corner-cupboard (c. 1745; J. Paul Getty Museum, Los Angeles) for Count Jan Klemens, based on a design by Nicolas Pineau, a lacquered bureau for Louis-Philippe, Duc d'Orléans (1725-85), and the 'de Vergennes' marquetry bureau (both Musée du Louvre, Paris), a commode (Palazzo Reale, Genoa) for Louis XV's daughter Louise-Elizabeth (1727-59) and a large lean-to secrétaire with doors and windows (1770; Waddesdon Manor, Buckinghamshire). After Dubois's death, his son René Dubois (1737-1799) continued the workshop, using his father's mark but producing rigorously Neo-classical furniture. The inventory made after Jacques Dubois's death reveals a large workshop with a varied range of production including secrétaires, writing desks, pedestals, and clocks, decorated with floral marquetry or with Chinese or Japanese lacquer.

He entered the French Navy in 1837. On a trip around the world he began sketching. Returning, he lived on a small inheritance and began to study painting, but a severe condition of colour-blindness drove him into colourless drawing and etching. He worked mainly on architectural subjects done in a severely romantic style. He is best known for his etchings of Paris 1850-54 that encompass straightforward topographical views along with romantic and disturbing fantasies. He suffered mental illness, and died in the famous insane asylum at Charenton (in a suburb of Paris). "

32793,George Stubbs,1724,1806,"Outstanding English animal painter and anatomical draftsman. The son of a prosperous tanner, Stubbs was briefly apprenticed to a painter but was basically self-taught. His interest in anatomy, revealed at an early age, became one of the driving passions of his life. His earliest surviving works are 18 plates etched for Dr. John Burton's Essay Towards a Complete New System of Midwifery (1751). In the 1750s Stubbs made an exhaustive analysis of the anatomy of the horse. He rented a farmhouse in a remote Lincolnshire village, where, over a period of 18 months, he undertook the painstaking dissection of innumerable specimens. After moving permanently to London in 1760, Stubbs etched the plates for Anatomy of the Horse (1766), which became a major work of reference for naturalists and artists alike. Stubbs soon established a reputation as the leading painter of portraits of the horse. His masterly depictions of hunters and racehorses brought him innumerable commissions. Perhaps more impressive than the single portraits are his pictures of informal groups of horses, such as Mares and Foals in a Landscape (c. 1760-70; Tate Gallery, London). Stubbs also painted a wide variety of other animals, including the lion, tiger, giraffe, monkey, and rhinoceros, which he was able to observe in private menageries. According to the artist Ozias Humphrey, Stubbs was so convinced of the importance of observation that he visited Italy in 1754 only to reinforce his belief that nature is superior to art. Among Stubbs's best-known pictures are several depicting a horse being frightened or attacked by a lion (Horse Frightened by a Lion, 1770) in which he emphasizes the wild terror of the former and the predatory power of the latter. Stubbs's historical paintings are among the least successful of his works; much more convincing are his scenes of familiar country activities done in the 1770s. Unfortunately, he tended to execute his paintings in thin oil paint, and relatively few survive in undamaged condition. In later life Stubbs knew considerable hardship. His last years were spent on a final work of anatomical analysis: A Comparative Anatomical Exposition of the Structure of the Human Body, with that of a Tiger and Common Fowl, for which he completed 100 drawings and 18 engravings. The Anatomical Works of George Stubbs was published in 1975. "

His earliest known works are a series of prints dated 1594 that continue in his father's tradition; they were published by Assuerus van Londerseel (1572-1635), although de Bruyn later published his own works. He married Assuerus's sister Suzanna van Londerseel, and their brother Jan van Londerseel became his student. De Bruyn was registered in 1601 as a master in Antwerp's Guild of St Luke; by 1617 he is recorded in Rotterdam, where he worked for the rest of his life. An inventory of his possessions in 1632 included a house on the Rijweg in Gouda, a quantity of copper plates and paintings by him and prints by his contemporaries; none of his own paintings has been identified.

41747,Adam Elsheimer,1578,1610," German painter, one of the first masters of the idyllic landscape. He was trained in the dry manner of Flemish realism, but he acquired a liberating interest in light, atmosphere, and color when he settled (1598) in Italy. In Venice he worked with his countryman Rottenhammer, then settled in Rome in 1600. His early Mannerist style gave way to a more direct manner in which he showed great sensitivity to effects of light; his nocturnal scenes are particularly original, bringing out the best in his lyrical temperament, and he is credited with being the first artist to represent the constellations of the night sky accurately (in The Flight into Egypt). He painted a few pictures in which figures predominate, but generally they are fused into a harmonious unity with their landscape settings. They are invariably on a small scale and on copper (the only exception is a self-portrait in the Uffizi, Florence, of doubtful attribution), but although exquisitely executed they have a grandeur out of all proportion to their size. Elsheimer achieved fame during his lifetime and there are numerous contemporary copies of his works. His paintings were engraved by his pupil and patron, the Dutch amateur artist Count Hendrick Goudt (1573-1648), and Elsheimer himself made a number of etchings. In spite of his popularity he was personally unsuccessful and died in poverty. Sandrart says he suffered from melancholia and was often unable to work; apparently he was imprisoned for debt. Rubens was a friend of Elsheimer and after his death lamented his ""sin of sloth, by which he has deprived the world of the most beautiful things""; he also wrote ""I have never seen his equal in the realm of small figures, of landscapes, and of so many other subjects."" Although Elsheimer died young and his output was small he played a key role in the development of 17th-century landscape painting, and his influence is apparent in the work of many other 17th-century artists.

42242,John Robert Cozens,1752,1797,"Painter, draughtsman and printmaker, part of an English family of artists, son of Alexander Cozens, who is best known for drawings of imaginary mountain landscapes. His son, John Robert Cozens (1752- 97), was also a landscape painter. Most of his work derived from two continental journeys in 1776-79 and 1782-83, during which he visited Italy and Switzerland. On the first he was probably draughtsman to Richard Payne Knight, and on the second he was part of the entourage of William Beckford (a former pupil of his father). In 1793 he became insane and was cared for by Dr Monro. Although his watercolours were based on sketches made on the spot, he by no means restricted himself to topographical exactitude and he often transposed landscape features in the interests of a more poetical composition. But he does not seem ever to have composed wholly from imagination, as his father did. His narrow but subtly gradated range of subdued colour is intensely evocative of the serene natural effects which appealed so strongly to his poetic melancholy. He was the most talented of the English landscape artists in the Picturesque tradition and his work was admired and copied by Constable (who called him 'the greatest genius that ever touched landscape'), Girtin, and Turner.

34997,John Hoppner,1758,1810,"English painter of German descent, born in London. He was the son of a German lady-in-waiting to Queen Charlotte, wife of King George III. From an early age he received protection and support from King George III, leading to speculation at the time that he may have been his son, although this has never been proved. Brought up at the British court, he trained as a chorister at the Chapel Royal. When he chose to reject this course of study in favour of enrolment in the Royal Academy schools, he received an allowance from the king. After the death of Reynolds, he and Lawrence were the leading portraitists in the country. In his attempts to emulate first Reynolds, then Lawrence, Hoppner rarely achieved striking individuality, but his best work, particularly his portraits of women and children, often has great charm. He became an established portrait painter, whose court connections earned him many prestigious sitters. However, his wife's vocal support for the rebels in the War of American Independence tarnished his favour there, although this did not prevent his appointment as Portrait Painter to the Prince of Wales in 1789. Hoppner exhibited at the Royal Academy from 1780 to 1809, being elected Academician in 1795. He was a popular portrait painter, who, in the taste of the time, combined sympathetic representation of his sitters with romantic and noble poses, as can be seen in the expression and lowered viewpoint adopted in his portrait of Vice-Admiral Lord Hugh Seymour (National Maritime Museum, London). His son, Richard Belgrave Hoppner also became a painter, but chose to specialize in marine scenes rather than portraiture. "

41878,Juan del Castillo,1584,1640,"Spanish painter, one of Seville's leading painters of the 1630s and 1640s. Little is known about his life, documents establish the boundaries of his career as 1611 and 1650. Scholars also know that he was related by marriage to painter Alonso Cano, his Sevillan peer, and to Bartolomé Esteban Murillo, who became Castillo's apprentice. Castillo's painting derived from that of Francisco Pacheco and other Sevillian masters of the late 16th century and early 17th, his Sevillan predecessors influenced Castillo's warm palette. He was later influenced by the naturalism and warmer palette of Juan de Roelas and by the many examples of Italian painting, especially Venetian, circulating in Seville at the time. The naturalism that distinguished his manner derived from the Venetian paintings that were relatively abundant in Seville. Castillo's most important commission was a series of paintings for the altarpiece of a convent in Seville, beginning in 1636. Taddeo Zuccaro's painting of the same subject inspired his composition for the central panel of the Assumption of the Virgin, but Castillo derived the movement and theatricality of some figures from Peter Paul Rubens's style. Castillo's carefully painted landscape backgrounds establish him as one of Seville's key contributors to that tradition during the 1600s. He influenced the highly renowned Murillo in both naturalism and figure style. "

13758,William Kent,1684,1748,"English architect, interior designer, landscape gardener, and painter, a principal master of the Palladian architectural style in England and pioneer in the creation of the ""informal"" English garden. Kent was said to have been apprenticed to a coach painter at Hull. Local patrons, impressed by his talent, sent him to study painting in Rome from 1709 to 1719. There he studied under Benedetto Luti. In Rome he also met the Earl of Burlington, the foremost architectural patron of the 18th century in England and the principal promoter of Andrea Palladio's classical building style (Palladianism). He took Kent back to London in 1719 to decorate Burlington House in Piccadilly, where Kent then lived for the rest of his life. The association with Burlington had a determining effect on Kent's rather severe architectural style, which was characterized by well-proportioned masses arranged in simple relationships. Although later Neoclassical architects, such as Robert Adam, were to criticize Kent's works as ""immeasurably ponderous,"" his influence on them was considerable. Kent was also familiar with the style of Inigo Jones, whose Designs (published 1727) Kent edited. By the 1730s Kent had become a fashionable architect. Among his principal buildings is Holkham Hall, Norfolk (begun 1734). Here, as in other works, Kent designed interiors and even furniture, becoming one of the earliest English architects to plan a house in one unified design scheme. Kent's best known works came out of his appointment, through Burlington's influence, as a master carpenter in the Office of Works (1725). The Royal Mews (1732), the treasury buildings, Whitehall (1734-36), and the Horse Guards Building in Whitehall (1750-58; completed after Kent's death) are all part of Burlington's grand intention of rectifying the sorry state of England's architecture by adhering more closely to classical precedent. The rather theatrical interiors of some of these structures, as of the masterful No. 44 Berkeley Square (1742-44), and Kent's taste for fanciful Gothic style in furniture designs suggest that he wore his Palladianism lightly and that, in the absence of Burlington's overpowering influence, Kent might as easily have become a master of the Baroque. It was in his gardens - conceived of as natural landscapes to contrast with the classical severity of his buildings - that Kent may have achieved his freest expression. He created gardens at Rousham Hall, Oxfordshire (1738-41), and Stowe House, Buckinghamshire, where winding paths and open vistas lead to small classical temples in informal wooded glades. In describing the revolt from formality in garden design, Horace Walpole wrote that Kent saw that ""all Nature was a garden."" The informal and irregular landscaping at these sites and others, such as Pope's Villa, Twickenham, Middlesex (for Alexander Pope; c. 1730), and Richmond Gardens, Surrey, were a marked departure from the manicured, symmetrical precision of French gardens such as those at Versailles. The English style soon crossed the Channel and had a substantial impact in France during the second half of the 18th century. "

37529,Jean-Victor Schnetz,1787,1870,"French painter and printmaker. He trained first under Jacques-Louis David and then under Jean-Baptiste Regnault, Antoine-Jean Gros and François Gérard. He made his début at the Salon in 1808 and exhibited there until 1867. It was in 1819, however, that he established his reputation by winning the gold medal for history painting. The following year he exhibited one of his most important paintings, A Gypsy Predicting the Future of Sixte-Quinte (1820; untraced). After this there followed a number of paintings on historical and religious subjects such as General Condé at the Battle of Rocroy (1824; Versailles, Château), Eudes, Comte de Paris, Raising the Siege of Paris in 886 (1837; Versailles, Château) and Procession of Crusaders around Jerusalem the Day Before the Taking of the Town, 14 July 1099 (1841; Versailles, Château). In all these works he took subjects of the type favoured by the Romantics and enhanced their dramatic potential by the dominant use of reds and yellows. The paintings had however an underlying coolness resulting from his Neoclassical training under David, and their main importance lies in this bridging of the two schools of Romanticism and Neo-classicism.

40414,Andrea del Sarto,1486,1530,"Italian painter, nicknamed Andrea ""of the tailor"" after his father's occupation. His real name was Andrea d'Agnolo di Francesco. He is, alongside Fra Bartolommeo, the supreme exponent of Florentine early High Renaissance style and the counterpart of Michelangelo and Raphael, active in Rome. He was the best painter (as opposed to draughtsman) in 16th-century Florence, and had more feeling for tone and colour than any of his contemporaries south of Venice. He was the first Florentine to depart from the coloured-drawing approach in favour of composition by coloured patches of light and shade, although his actual draughtsmanship is derived from Michelangelo. He also borrowed from the newly-arrived prints by Dürer. Except for a visit to Rome around 1511, where his style gained greater monumentality, and a year-long stay in France in 1518, where he completed a few works at the invitation of François I, he spent most of his life in Florence. As a fresco painter he made his name with a series of grisailles in the cloister of the Scalzi in Florence, depicting the story of the Baptist (1511-26), and the Miracles of San Filippo Benizzi (1509-10) in SS. Annunziata. These were followed by his most famous frescoes, epitomizing the High Renaissance style in Florence, the Birth of the Virgin (1514) and the Madonna del Sacco (1525), both also in the Annunziata. In 1517 or 1518 he married a wealthy widow who had modeled for him for several years, both for portraits and for Madonnas. He went to France in 1518/19 at the invitation of François I and was well received there, but he broke his contract in order to return to his wife, who, in the opinion of contemporaries, ruined him. Andrea's works are of great importance in the evolution of Florentine painting, especially the Holy Families, often in half-length. His Madonnas are notable for their softly atmospheric qualities and the richness of their colour, in contrast to the linear definition and clear, bright hues of artists like Botticelli and Ghirlandaio. The Madonna delle Arpie (1517, Florence, Uffizi), is a purely classical work comparable with Raphael's Madonnas. Sarto is, however, a starting point for Mannerism, since his pupils included Pontormo, Rosso Fiorentino, and Vasari,. Andrea's process of making a series of preparatory drawings before painting demonstrated his patient pursuit of perfection and became a pattern for later artists. He was an excellent draughtsman, the best collection of his drawings is in the Uffizi. "

37179,Rudolf von Alt,1812,1905,"Austrian painter, draughtsman and printmaker. Born as Rudolf Alt, he could call himself von Alt and bear the title of a Ritter after he gained nobility in 1889. He was the son of the famous lithographer Jakob Alt. Von Alt was perhaps the most productive and accomplished watercolour painter in German-speaking Europe in the 19th century. On his frequent travels he produced local views, landscapes and interiors, often commissioned by aristocratic patrons. He studied with his father, Jakob Alt (1789-1872), a landscape and watercolour painter and one of the first to use the new technique of lithography. From the age of six Rudolf accompanied him on study trips, and, together with Alt's other children, he coloured his father's drawings. During his student days at the Akademie der Bildenden Künste in Vienna (1825-32), Rudolf joined his father on further journeys and collaborated in his studio. In 1832 he won a prize, which simultaneously freed him from military service and marked the beginning of his independent artistic activity. In the same year he produced his first oil painting, after his own watercolour, of the Stephansdom, Vienna (Vienna, Belvedere), a subject that he treated on many occasions until 1898. In 1833 he and his father travelled to northern Italy; Venice, in particular, made a lasting impression on him. Two years later he went to Rome and Naples. In the brilliant southern light Alt adopted a far wider range for his radiant and transparent colour. Many of his views of Italy, and also those of locations throughout the Austro-Hungarian Empire, were intended for use in a peep-show, commissioned by the Austrian Archduke (later Emperor) Ferdinand. Alt continued to receive such official commissions until 1848. Rudolf von Alt's official commissions earned him a variety of titles and awards. His success allowed him to accept or decline work as he chose. He created a series of landscapes, town views and building interiors for Vienna Academy, but declined a professorship to the Vienna Academy in 1867. Alt demonstrated a remarkable talent for expressing certain peculiarities in nature. He managed to paint nature authentically by focusing on the different hues of sky, the colour-tone of the air and the vegetation. His later works came closer to Impressionism. His perspectives on architecture were interesting, and he often chose everyday objects to paint. The painting of interior-views also became one of his strong points, giving him an admiring following in Vienna. One of the founding members of the Vienna Künstlerhaus (Austrian Artist's Society), von Alt became its president in 1874, and was later appointed honorary president of the Vienna Secession. Traveling extensively until well into old age before his death in 1905, Rudolf von Alt amassed a body of more than 5000 works - most of them watercolours depicting landscapes in topographically precise proportions. His younger brother Franz Alt, (1821-1914) was also a painter. "

40802,Martin Johann Schmidt,1718,1801,"Martin Johann Schmidt (so-called Kremser Schmidt) was the most significant Austrian painter in the second half of the 18th century beside Maulbertsch. He was a versatile and fertile master, whose frescoes, altarpieces, mythological-allegorical paintings, genre paintings, and portraits were popular throughout the Empire. He studied with modest local masters, and lived and worked in Stein and Krems until his death in 1801. In his stein workshop he undertook the numerous mostly ecclesiastical commissions making altarpieces and religious paintings for the churches and monasteries of Lower an Upper Austria, Moravia and Hungary. His fame was attested by his admission to the Viennese Academy in 1768. In the last quarter of the century, when the increasing predominance of the Josephinist view contributed to the diminishing of church commissions, and while also the artistic trends raised new compelled to change his style and adopt new artistic approaches. From the 1790s he was increasingly engaged in secular genres and profane themes, and he made in series his small paintings with themes and figures from ancient history and everyday life. His late activity is significantly bound to engraving. His oeuvre, comprising several hundreds of paintings combines the influences of Italian and Netherlandish masters and the most varied tendencies of 18th century painting. His altarpieces and monumental paintings, show a dramatic Late Baroque animation, the sometimes exotic richness of his biblical stories evokes the models of Rembrandt, while in his genre paintings the vividness of French Rococo can be felt, in a particular and individual ensemble.

He  moved to Paris in the second half of the 1780s and there he embarked upon his academic training to become a peintre d'histoire. He became both friend and pupil of the Neoclassical painter, Jacques-Louis David, and exhibited at the Salons of 1793, 1798, 1801 and 1804. He painted biblical and mythological themes, as well as family portraits. A capable draughtsman and watercolourist, Bosio taught drawing in the École Polytechnique from its opening in 1794 and published a thesis on the art of drawing anatomy and antique sculpture. He also worked as an engraver, and worked for newspapers. In around 1805, following the death of his wife, Bosio settled in Milan, then under French imperial rule. Here he produced engraved portraits of the imperial family. In 1818, Bosio returned to Paris, where he continued to paint and exhibit at the Salon: in 1819 he exhibited a Death of the Virgin which had been commissioned for the cathedral of Chartres, and three years later he executed a full-length portrait of Louis XVIII.

His most famous work is a very reduced copy of the Last Judgement by Michelangelo. In 1558 he settled in Venice, where, in the absence of Cornelis Cort, Titian entrusted him with the reproduction of several of his paintings. In the same city he also worked after Cornelis Cort and Federico Zuccaro and discovered the work of Dürer, after whom he copied the scenes of the Small Passion. In 1568 he left for Vienna, where he apparently worked as a painter and sculptor. His oeuvre comprises c. 120 prints, of which more than half are portraits. "

36154,James Peale,1749,1831,"American painter, member of a family of artists who were active from c. 1760 to c. 1880, and their commitment to art during a period of revolution and nation-building contributed in a large way to the growth of American artistic interests and institutions. The family was established in America by the English post-office clerk Charles Peale (1709-50), a convicted embezzler exiled to the colonies in 1736. His first son, the portrait painter Charles Willson Peale (1741-1827), exerted a major influence on American painting through his own work and that of his sons, brothers and nieces. James Peale was the brother of Charles Willson Peale. Charles encouraged him to become a painter; James also worked as a frame-maker for his brother until the Revolution, in which he served as a lieutenant. From 1779 James shared Charles's practice, specializing in miniatures. His early work, occasionally confused with Charles's, shows his brother's influence. After 1794, his style became clearly his own: more delicate with subtle colour harmonies, softened outlines and free handling; it may be distinguished by a faint violet tone in the shadows and the inconspicuous signature ‘IP'. His miniatures of male subjects are frequently superior to his portraits of women, but his meticulous attention to costume and his success in imparting colour and sparkle to skin and eyes compensate for drawing deficiencies. James Peale played a significanr role in developing a Philadelphia school of still-life. "

The common interest in an anticlassical, anti-Mannerist style shared by the artists of the academy led them to seek a powerful naturalistic immediacy in their paintings. Perhaps before anyone else, Aurelio Luini returned to the rich corpus of Leonardesque drawings to restudy anatomy. Luini also revived two practices strongly favoured by Leonardo himself, drawing from life and using a variety of models. "

33643,Bartolomeo Biscaino,1632,1657,"Italian painter, draughtsman and etcher. His life was cut short by the plague, and little is known about him. He was taught by his father, Giovanni Andrea Biscaino (1605-1657), a mediocre landscape painter, and entered the workshop of Valerio Castello, probably at the end of the 1640s. Biscaino's early paintings strongly recalled his master's style, but his forms were softer, his brushstroke broader, and his choice of colours more delicate. Curving draperies and sweetness of expression typified Biscaino's manner. The chronology of his oeuvre, truncated by his early death, is hard to reconstruct. Only two paintings bear early documentation: St Ferrando Imploring the Virgin (Genoa, Palazzo Bianco) and an untraced Flaying of Marsyas. Scholars often date Biscaino's canvases on the basis of his forty catalogued etchings, and he remains best known for his drawings and prints. About half the etchings are signed or initialed, and two are dated. From them it is possible to attribute further works, mostly small canvases, to Biscaino, and to characterize his development. Giovanni Benedetto Castiglione influenced the iconography and technique of Biscaino's etchings. In his rendering of animals, figures, and naturalistic settings, and the play of light and shade, Castiglione also provided an important example for Biscaino's later paintings. "

He was born in Bologna and worked mainly in Milan, where the family settled when he was a child, and also in Modena and Genoa. Initially he worked mainly as a sculptor, but after about 1600 he concentrated on painting and became one of the leading painters in Milan. His style was eclectic but often very powerful, combining something of the emotional tension of Mannerism with the dynamism and sense of physical presence of the Baroque. His colours tend to be acidic, his handling of light and shade dramatic. Many of his paintings are still in Milan, but two large scenes from Christ's Passion (perhaps part of a series) are in Edinburgh and Sheffield. His father Ercole, and his brothers, Camillo and Carlo Antonio were also painters."

26284,James Tissot,1836,1902,"James (originally Jacques Joseph) Tissot, French painter, printmaker and enamellist. He grew up in a port, an experience reflected in his later paintings set on board ship. He moved to Paris c. 1856 and became a pupil of Louis Lamothe and Hippolyte Flandrin. He made his Salon début in 1859 and continued to exhibit there successfully until he went to London in 1871. His early paintings exemplify Romantic obsessions with the Middle Ages, while works such as the Meeting of Faust and Marguerite (1861; Paris, Musée d'Orsay) and Marguerite at the Ramparts (1861; untraced) show the influence of the Belgian painter Baron Henri Leys. In the mid-1860s Tissot abandoned these tendencies in favour of contemporary subjects, sometimes with a humorous intent, as in Two Sisters (1864; Paris, Musée du Louvre) and Beating the Retreat in the Tuileries Gardens (1868; private collection). The painting Young Ladies Looking at Japanese Objects (1869; private collection) testifies to his interest in things Oriental, and Picnic (1869; private collection), in which he delved into the period of the Directoire, is perhaps influenced by the Goncourt brothers. Tissot re-created the atmosphere of the 1790s by dressing his characters in historical costume. After participating in the Franco-Prussian War he stayed for 10 years in London, where he was highly esteemed for his genre scenes (e.g., The Ball on Shipboard). In 1882 he went to Palestine and devoted his life to a series of watercolour drawings illustrating the Bible. "

He won the Grand Prix in 1776 for ""un château pour un grand seigneur."" He worked in Sweden during the last twenty years of his life. He traveled frequently to Italy and was associated with Piranesi in Rome, when he came to the attention of Swedish King Gustavus III, who offered him a two-year contract as director of scenic decorations at the new Stockholm Opera founded by the King two years earlier. As an architect, Desprez designed in a monumental, Neoclassical style influenced by his study of Greek and Roman ruins in the south of Italy and in Sicily. A good example of this is Hämeenlinna Church in Finland - Finland at that time still being part of the Swedish kingdom - completed in 1799. His greatest project was one never realized: the magnificent new palace planned by the King for the Haga Park outside Stockholm. Because of lack of money, only the foundations were ever built and the project was abandoned after the assassination of the King. The smaller ""royal pavilion"" which stands at Haga was built by another architect, Olof Tempelman (1745-1816). His most significant completed project was the conservatory building in the new botanical garden in Uppsala, inaugurated after his death on May 13, 1807, the 100th anniversary of Linnaeus's birth. He also built the Villa Frescati in 1791-92 for Gustaf Mauritz Armfelt, after which the whole Frescati area in Stockholm later was named. "

33710,Sandro Botticelli,1444,1510,"Italian painter, born Alessandro di Moriano Filipepi, Botticelli is one of the outstanding geniuses in the history of Western art. He began his training under Filippo Lippi, alongside Filippino, and seemingly worked for a time with Leonardo in Verrocchio's workshop. He was influenced by the Pollaiuoli for a short time around 1470, when he painted a Fortitude to go with a set of six other Virtues by Piero Pollaiuolo (all seven now in the Uffizi). His understanding of perspective and foreshortening, of architectural design and, indeed, of anatomy, were all that might have been expected of a man with such a background, but it is to the pure visual poetry of the outcome that he owes his fame. His manipulations of the visual facts for artistic purposes should no more be put down to ignorance or inability in these respects than in the case of Picasso in the 20 century. Although he was a superb colourist, delicate at times, strong at others, and capable, in his last years, of harsh and powerful effects, the essence of his art lies in the unsurpassed, singing quality of his line. This can be seen at its purest in the series of splendid outline drawings with which he illustrated Dante's Divine comedy (Staatliche Museen, Berlin; Vatican, Rome). These drawings, made probably in the 1490s, show his sensitive feeling for contour at its most subtle. The chronology of his work is difficult to establish, since it ranges between the vigorous realism of the 1470 Fortitude and the languorous and anti-naturalistic ecstasy of his last dated (and only signed) work, the Mystic Nativity (1500, National Gallery, London). A series of Adorations of the Magi painted in the 1470s and early 80s, notably those in the National Galleries in London and Washington and the Uffizi, Florence, show Botticelli experimenting with the new pyramidal, centralized form which was taken up by Leonardo. They also show the ability as a portraitist which he demonstrated in a number of full-scale works, for they contain, particularly in the case of the Uffizi panel, a whole gallery of Medici portraits. As with the technical aspects of his art, so in terms of the ideas which underlie it Botticelli moved in the highest circles: much of his work is imbued with the ideas of the Florentine neo-Platonists surrounding Lorenzo de' Medici, and particularly of Marsilio Ficino. But just as he was neither a 'perspectivist' nor an 'anatomist', so he was clearly not a neo-Platonist in the sense that his work could be taken as a straightforward transfer into visual terms of particular philosophical precepts. In 1481/2 he was in Rome, painting frescoes in the Sistine Chapel along with Ghirlandaio, Rosselli, Signorelli and Perugino, but these do not seem to have been particularly successful (he painted few frescoes). During the last twenty years of the 15th century he ran a large shop for the production of Madonnas of a gently devout kind, well suited to the piety of the age: these made him prosperous and many of them are repetitions by different hands from cartoons by him. His great series of mythologies, also of the 1470s and 80s, the Mars and Venus (London, National Gallery), the Primavera, the Birth of Venus, the Pallas and the Centaur (Florence, Uffizi), have been the subject of innumerable essays in interpretation without ever losing that essential, multi-faceted ambiguity which is characteristic of his approach to visual description. The central figure in the Primavera is as much a Christian Virgin as a figure from antiquity. The classic group of the Three Graces owes as much to Gothic as to antique linear sensitivity. Indeed, however deeply he may have been involved in the particular attempt at Christian-classical synthesis which was characteristic of the humanist Medici circle, he was later intimately involved with Savonarola. By about 1500 his style was so obviously opposed to the new ideas of Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo that he suffered a decline in popularity, and the last ten years of his life are mysterious. It is probable that the clumsy, almost hysterical, style of works like the Pietàs in Milan (Poldi-Pezzoli) and Munich, the ruined Crucifixion in Cambridge Mass. (Fogg), or the St Zenobius series in London (National Gallery), Dresden and New York (Metropolitan Museum) is that of his last period. "

36457,Dante Gabriel Rossetti,1828,1882,"English poet and painter, son of an Italian political refugee in London. He was taught drawing by Cotman and after a few unsuccessful months with Ford Madox Brown he went to Holman Hunt in 1848. Under Hunt's guidance he painted his first major work, The Girlhood of Mary Virgin, the first picture exhibited (in March 1849) with the initials of the PRB (Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood). His adherence to the tenets of the Brotherhood was, however, very shortlived. His subjects were drawn mostly from Dante and from a medieval dream-world also reflected in his verse, e.g. The Wedding of St George, or Arthur's Tomb. Many of these were highly-elaborated watercolours. In 1850 he met Elizabeth Siddal, who also posed for Hunt and Millais, and from 1852 onwards she developed under his inspiration into an artist of poetic and neurotic intensity. His best work was produced during the years of their uneasy association. They married in 1860; in 1862 she died of narcotics and he became virtually a recluse and eventually a chloral addict. In 1857 he was concerned (with Morris, Burne-Jones and others) in the decoration of the Oxford Union and he did one painting directly on a white-washed wall. It perished immediately. His poor technique and his use of studio assistants are obvious in many of his later works. From the 1860s Elizabeth Siddal's place was taken by Morris's wife Jane, and he painted many versions of the full-lipped sultry beauty which came to be associated with his name. "

35806,Pier Francesco Mola,1612,1666,"Italian Baroque painter, active mainly in Rome. Although he trained there with Cesari and in Bologna with Albani, his style, characterized by warm colouring and soft modelling, was formed mainly on the example of Guercino and Venetian art (his early career is not well documented, but he probably spent most of the period 1633-47 in north Italy). He painted frescoes in Roman churches and palaces, and his best-known painting is the striking Barbary Pirate (Louvre, Paris, 1650), but his most characteristic works are fairly small canvases with religious or mythological figures set in landscapes. They are somewhat reminiscent of Albani, but much freer, and closer in spirit to Salvator Rosa, with whom Mola was one of the chief representatives of a distinctively romantic strain in Roman painting in the mid 17th century.

25410,Taddeo di Bartolo,1362,1422,"Sienese painter, active in Pisa, Perugia, San Gimignano, and Volterra, his native city. He was the son of the barber Bartolo di Mino, and he was under 25 in 1386 when he was first recorded, painting statuettes of angels for the new choir-stalls in Siena Cathedral. In 1388–89 he was a counsellor to the Cathedral Works and in 1389 he was first listed as an independent painter. His earliest dated work is the polyptych of the Virgin and Child with Saints (1389; private collection), painted for the chapel of S Paolo at Collegarli, near San Miniato al Tedesco. The thin, elegant figures and curvilinear drapery patterns show aspects of Taddeo's early style to be linked with the works of the preceding generation of Sienese painters, and, like his contemporaries, he looked back to earlier models by Simone Martini and the Lorenzetti. He was a conservative artist, but is noteworthy for his series of frescos on Roman Republican heroes and civic Virtues (1406-14) in the Palazzo Pubblico, Siena, which are early examples of a type that became popular in the Renaissance.

33747,Bartholomeus Breenbergh,1598,1657,"Dutch painter, with Poelenburgh the leading pioneer of the taste for Italianate landscapes in the Netherlands. Breenbergh spent most of the 1620s in Italy and thereafter worked in Amsterdam. His style as a painter is very similar to Poelenburgh's, his biblical and mythological characters set in well-balanced views of the Roman Campagna, often complete with classical ruins. His drawings are much fresher and bolder, and have often passed under the name of Claude, as is the case with two examples in Christ Church, Oxford. Late in his career Breenbergh turned to figure painting."

These illustrate an edition of Dante’s Divine Comedy published in 1481. A group of prints in the same Fine Manner style is attributed to Baldini. His designs incorporate figures and motifs derived from Botticelli, Piero Pollaiuolo and also German printmakers, such as the Master E.S. and Martin Schongauer, but particularly from Finiguerra. Baldini’s Fine Manner style developed from Finiguerra’s niello print technique; the rendering of spatial recession in the large Judgement Hall of Pilate (435 x 598 mm) suggests it was designed by Finiguerra. With the other prints, however, it shares the decorative quality and emphasis on pattern characteristic of Baldini. "

34128,Pietro Dandini,1646,1712,"Pietro Dandini, part of an Italian family of painters which made a significant contribution to the Florentine Baroque. The polished and elegant style of Cesare Dandini was continued by his younger brother Vincenzo Dandini. Their nephew Pietro Dandini, was Vincenzo's pupil, and Pietro's two sons, Ottaviano (1681-1740) and Vincenzo (1686-1734), a Jesuit, worked as painters in Florence. Pietro Dandini studied with Vincenzo during the 1650s, and he produced his first paintings at the age of 18. Having studied in Venice, Lombardy, Emilia and Rome, he carried out numerous commissions in Florence for frescoes and oil paintings in a style clearly influenced by Pietro da Cortona and Giordano. Principal works are ceiling decorations in fresco in Florence (c. 1685; S Maria Maddalena dei Pazzi), and the Triumph of Hercules and the Allegory of the World, Tyranny and War (1695-96; Florence, Galleria Corsini). He was praised by Baldinucci, his contemporary, as a painter of incomparable vitality, and, more recently, by Cantelli, as one of the most considerable artists in late 17th-century Florence for his combination of new directions, particularly those of Giordano, with the Florentine traditions of precise design, painterly execution and ingenuity of invention.

40639,Jozef Israëls,1824,1911,"Dutch painter and etcher, often called the ""Dutch Millet"". He was, during his lifetime, the most internationally celebrated Dutch painter of the 19th century and a leader of the Hague School. He was particularly noted for his scenes of life among the Dutch fishing and peasant communities. He was born in Groningen, of Jewish parents. His father, Hartog Abraham Israels, intended for him to be a man of business, and it was only after a determined struggle that he was allowed to enter on an artistic career. He began his studies in Amsterdam and from 1845 to 1847 worked in Paris under the academic painters Horace Vernet and Paul Delaroche. Israëls first tried to establish himself as a painter of Romantic portraits and conventional historical pictures but had achieved little success when in 1855 ill health compelled him to leave Amsterdam for the fishing village of Zandvoort, near Haarlem. That change of scenery revolutionized his art: he turned to realistic and compassionate portrayals of the Dutch peasantry and fisherfolk. In 1871 he moved to The Hague, and he often worked in nearby Scheveningen. Besides oils, Israëls worked in watercolours and was an etcher of the first rank. His later works in all media express a tragic sense of life and are generally treated in broad masses of light and shade. His painting style was influenced by Rembrandt's later works, and, like Rembrandt, Israëls often painted the poor Jews of the Dutch ghettos. His son Isaac, also a painter, adopted an Impressionist technique and subject matter and had some influence on his father's later work. "

He is known for history and religious scenes characterized by clarity, attention to detail, rich colour and classical figures, in addition to influence of the robust figure style, painterly surfaces and brilliant reds and golds of Rubens and Anthony Van Dyck. He worked in Rome from 1607 to 1617 and was swayed by the Caravaggists. In the 1630s he attempted to cast away the last vestiges of Mannerism and turned towards a freer, naturalistic manner, largely under the influence of Rubens and Van Dyck. Fiasella was prolific and much in fashion with the Genoese aristocracy. "
36953,Michael Thonet,1796,1871,"Austrian cabinet-maker of German birth. Around 1830 he began to develop the bentwood technique (long, narrow veneers glued together) to make Biedermeier chairs in Boppard; his new technique made it easier and cheaper to produce bold designs. In 1841, he applied for a patent in France and exhibited his bentwood products in Koblenz, after which Prince Klemens von Metternich invited him to move to Vienna. In 1842, Thonet presented his furniture to the Niederösterreichische Kunstgewerbeverein and received a licence authorizing him to practise in Vienna. From that time, he and his sons, Franz (1820-1898), Michael (1824-1902), August (1829-1910), Josef (1830-1887) and Jakob (1841-1929), began to produce cheap furniture in the workshop of the Viennese master joiner Clemens List. From 1843 to 1847, Thonet worked under the direction of the English architect Peter Hubert Desvignes (1804-1883), together with Carl Leistler, on the refurbishment of the Baroque Palais Liechtenstein in Vienna; Thonet made the parquet floors and produced several extremely light stools. In 1849, Thonet started his own cabinetmaking business and, in 1850, he was commissioned to make chairs to furnish the Café Daum, Vienna. In 1851, he exhibited luxury furniture, which reflected the contemporary taste for Rococo, at the Great Exhibition in London. In 1852, he applied for a licence to bend laminated veneers in any direction (although he had already applied this technique to the furniture for the Palais Liechtenstein), and he set up a shop in central Vienna. In 1853, he made the business over to his five sons, and in 1856 the Gebrüder Thonet applied for a licence to bend solid wood. It was not until the last quarter of the 19th century that the factory started to be truly successful with its serial manufacture of bentwood furniture, in particular its chair No. 14, which is still produced today. The company also produced furniture to designs by major Jugendstil artists such as Otto Wagner, Adolf Loos and Josef Hoffmann, and thereby made a significant contribution to the history of 20th-century furniture design.

In 1740, he went to Italy and published an illustrated description of the excavations at Herculaneum. He became Keeper of paintings for the King's Pictures in 1765. With Arthur Pond, he made a series of engravings of the most famous paintings. The most notable of these are his landscapes after Guercino. Knapton is noted for his paintings and portraits in pastel. Knapton was a founder-member of the Roman Club in 1723, a society of literary men and artists with aspirations to connoisseurship. "

35386,Giovanni Lanfranco,1582,1647,"Italian Baroque painter. He was born near Parma, where he was a pupil of Agostino Carracci, and was also much influenced by the domes by Correggio. He was in Rome in 1612, and about 1616 decorated the ceiling of the Casino Borghese in a manner derived entirely from the Farnese Gallery. He developed Correggio's sotto in sù type of illusionism to an extravagant point, and painted several domes and apses in Roman and Neapolitan churches in this manner. To him Domenichino lost part of the commission for the decoration of Sant'Andrea della Valle in Rome, a slight he resented so bitterly that - so the story goes - he weakened part of the scaffolding, hoping that Lanfranco would break his neck. Lanfranco completed the dome with an Assumption, Correggiesque in inspiration, between 1625-27, and such was its success that he was then employed at St Peter's until 1631. From 1633/34 to 1646 he was in Naples, and in 1641-43 painted the dome of the San Gennaro chapel in the Cathedral, which by its more up-to-date illusionism and greater showiness appealed far more to local tastes than Domenichino's works there. His dome is based on Correggio's type of illusionism and replaces one actually begun by Domenichino. He died in Rome, where his last work was the apse of San Carlo ai Catinari. Apart from Rome and Naples, there are works in Amsterdam Berlin, Dublin, Florence (Pitti), London (Coram Foundation), Lyons, Madrid (Prado), Marseilles, Oxford (Ashmolean), Paris (Louvre), Parma, St Petersburg, Versailles and Vienna.

36400,Luca della Robbia,1400,1482," Florentine sculptor, the most famous member of a family of artists. Nothing is known of his early career, and he was a mature artist by the time of his first documented work — a Cantoria (Singing Gallery, 1431-38) for Florence Cathedral, now in the Cathedral Museum. It is a work of considerable originality as well as enormous charm, antedating by a year or two the companion gallery by Donatello (now also in the Cathedral Museum). Its marble reliefs of angels and children singing, dancing, and making music reflect antique prototypes, but conceived in a more cheerful, less heroic spirit than Donatello's figures. In his own time Luca had the reputation of being one of the leaders of the modern (i.e. Renaissance) style, comparable to Donatello and Ghiberti in sculpture and Masaccio in painting, but he is now remembered mainly for his development of coloured, glazed terracotta as a sculptural medium — in particular for his highly popular invention of the type of the half-length Madonna and Child in white on a blue ground. The family workshop seems to have kept the technical formula a secret and it became the basis of a flourishing business; among the major works by Luca in the medium are the roundels of Apostles (c. 1444) in Brunelleschi's Pazzi Chapel in Santa Croce. Luca's business was carried on by his nephew Andrea, and later by Andrea's five sons, of whom Giovanni was the most important. The famous roundels of infants on the façade of the Foundling Hospital in Florence (1463-66) were probably made by Andrea. His successors tended to sentimentalize Luca's warm humanity, and in course of time the artists' studio became a potters' workshop-industry. "

40992,Balthasar Permoser,1651,1732,"Permoser was the leading Late Baroque sculptor in Dresden, where he helped to create the Zwinger. He was trained in Salzburg c. 1663 before going to Italy for fourteen years. He arrived there c. 1675 and went to Venice, Rome, Florence and other cities; in Florence he carved the façade of the S. Gaetano (c. 1684) and worked for the Grand Duke Cosimo III, who tried to secure him as Court Sculptor. Permoser, however, went to Dresden as Court Sculptor in 1689. He spent the rest of his life there, except for several trips to Berlin, a visit to Italy in 1697/98 and another in 1725, when, at the age of 74, he walked to Rome. He returned in 1728. As might be expected from his strong Italian leanings, he was much influenced by Bernini, but, like the other Northerners Puget, Donner and Schlüter, he introduced an element of restrained classicism - though this is not very obvious in his most famous work, the Apotheosis of Prince Eugene (1718-21, Vienna). Most of his Dresden works were damaged in 1945, but have been restored."

Beginning as a woodcarver, he worked in Boston (1837-c.1841) and New York City (c.1841-1844), studied in Florence, Italy (1844-1851), then settled in Rome. Most of his subjects were either from Greek mythology or romantic literature. A reoccurring theme was the vulnerability of women, a popular 19th-century idea that he expressed through innocent, modest looking female nudes. Ives' statue of Undine Receiving Her Soul, remains one of the icons of the American neo-classical movement. Ives was to revisit the subject of Undine in another work, Undine Rising from the Fountain. Two of his works are in the National Statuary Hall, Washington, D.C. Ives created many portraits of the well known persons of his time, many created in Rome of wealthy Americans who were traveling in Europe. "

In Holland he was influenced by Frans Hals and Jozef Israëls. His early works were realistic, but beginning about 1890 he developed a style closely related to Impressionism. As leader of the Berlin Secession group (1898-1910), he was instrumental in bringing French Impressionism to Germany, where younger artists were already moving toward expressionism. Liebermann depicted the life of the working classes, landscapes, outdoor group studies, and painted more than 200 portraits. In the 1880s he found his subjects in the orphanages and asylums for the old in Amsterdam and among the peasants and urban labourers of Germany and the Netherlands. A secular Jew and one of his country's most honoured artists, he was president of the Prussian Academy of Arts (1920-32) during the Weimar Republic. In his last year, however, he was forbidden to paint by the Nazis and his works were removed from museums and private collections. "

He executed a number of altarpieces for Florentine churches and his fresco in the Palazzo Capponi, Florence, is dated 1707. In 1674 he published his illustrated Fabbrica ed uso dell' Annulo Astronomico. A self-portrait in the Uffizi shows him aged eighty-two in 1709. He died in Florence on 5 January 1715. There are few signed or documented works, and Marinari's oeuvre has still to be clearly defined. "

22068,Abraham Roentgen,1711,1793,"German joiner and designer. He founded what became one of Europe's most widely renowned furniture workshops; he was the father of David Roentgen, the celebrated cabinetmaker to Queen Marie-Antoinette of France. After various jobs in Holland, the elder Roentgen settled (1731) in London and apparently was apprenticed in marquetry, engraving, and joinery. He became a member of the Moravian Church, a Protestant sect founded in Bohemia that emigrated to the British Isles in 1734. Returning to Germany in 1738, he departed in 1740 for North America as a Moravian missionary. Shipwrecked off the Irish coast, he temporarily worked in County Galway before returning to Germany, settling (1750) at Neuwied (just northwest of Cologne), where he opened a workshop that produced furniture of outstanding quality, often decorated with inlay work of ivory and other semiprecious materials. Much of this furniture was created for various German courts. Roentgen's son David succeeded him in 1772 as head of the firm; the two then worked in partnership until the senior Roentgen retired in 1784. The family workshop was famous for its fine Rococo-styled furniture and for music boxes, clocks, and mechanical toys. "

He was a pupil of Rembrandt in the mid-1630s and in his early work imitated his master's style so well as to create occasional difficulty in distinguishing between them. The portrait of Elizabeth Bas in the Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam, is the best-known instance; it was acknowledged as a Rembrandt until 1911, when it was attributed to Bol, and although this opinion is still generally accepted, there has been renewed support for Rembrandt as the author. As Bol's career prospered, both as a portraitist and a painter of historical subjects, his style moved away from that of Rembrandt, becoming blander and more elegant in the style of van der Helst. In 1669 he married a wealthy widow and seems to have stopped painting. Sir Godfrey Kneller was Bol's most distinguished pupil."

34503,Francesco Fontebasso,1707,1769,"Italian painter, printmaker and draughtsman, the last outstanding representative of Italian monumental painting. He was one of the most prolific and well-known followers of Sebastiano Ricci, with whom he had his earliest training, and particularly of Giambattista Tiepolo. By the end of the 1720s he had studied in Rome (where he is documented in 1728) and Bologna; the influence of the forthright tenebrism of the Bolognese school is evident in his first independent works, such as the Adoration of the Shepherds (c. 1732; Burano, S Martino). Around 1730 he was in Udine, where he studied Tiepolo's frescoes in the cathedral and in the archbishop's palace, and during the next few years he came into direct contact with Tiepolo, perhaps in Venice. Ricci remained influential, and in 1731 Fontebasso was engraving, in Venice, the altarpiece of St Gregory Interceding for Souls in Purgatory that Ricci had painted for S Alessandro della Croce in Bergamo. Fontebasso's work, however, increasingly emulated that of Tiepolo, with a consequent lightening and freeing of his palette. In Italy he worked with Tiepolo on the decoration of the Palazzo Barbarigo; with Diziani on the decoration of the Palazzo Bernardi (1743-50), and the Palazzo Contarini at S. Benedetto (c. 1748), and on his own at the Palazzo Boldu (1744-45), and the Palazzo Duolo (c. 1743). He worked in Russia in 1760-1762. He is the last outstanding representative of Italian monumental painting. "

After training and working briefly as a notary's clerk, he studied from 1836 at the Academie voor Beeldende Kunsten in The Hague, where he befriended Charles Rochussen and was especially influenced in his watercolour technique by the work of the Director, Andreas Schelfhout. Among his early wash drawings, Embarkation (1844; The Hague, Gemeentemuseum) provides evidence of a developed sense of this medium. In 1854, in response to a request from Comte Emilien de Nieuwerkerke, Schelfhout proposed Jongkind as a young Dutch artist who might profit from going to Paris to study in the studio of Eugène Isabey; Jongkind therefore accompanied Nieuwerkerke to Paris and was based there for the next ten years. His work during this period embraced oil painting of a sometimes markedly traditional Dutch character. Jongkind also made sketching trips away from Paris, especially during the early 1850s, returning to Dutch settings to paint, and also sketching frequently on the coasts of Brittany and Normandy, where the strong Atlantic light prompted some of his best watercolour work up to that point. In 1860 he becomes acquainted with a Dutch painter, Mrs Joséphine Fesser, with whom he falls in love and who will become his partner. In 1862, Jongkind gets acquainted with Boudin and Monet, with whom he goes painting to Le Havre. Every summer, Jongkind returns on the Norman Coast, between Trouville and Honfleur. There, a deep change takes place in his work, points of view are getting larger and more diversified, and the subtile game of light becomes the central element of his paintings and watercolours. It is this Norman period of Jongkind which situates him as the precursor of Impressionism. In 1868, Jongkind makes a series of Demolitions in Paris (watercolours and oils), far from merchant streets and touristic boulevards, where he represents men and horses at work. The Franco-Prussian war of 1870 drives Jongkind far from Paris, in Nantes then in Nevers. In 1878 he settled in la Côte-Saint-André, a small village in the Dauphiné area near Grenoble where he lead a quiet life until his death in 1891. "

41950,Jost Amman,1539,1591,"Swiss draughtsman, woodcutter, engraver, etcher and painter. He was the youngest son of the noted scholar and Chorherr in Zurich, Johann Jakob Amman, a friend of Ulrich Zwingli and Konrad Gessner. Although a successful pupil at the renowned Collegium Carolinum where his father was a professor, Jost, like his brother Josua (1531-64), who became a goldsmith, did not take up a scholarly career. As early as 1556-57 his copies of prints by other artists, for example Dürer and Virgil Solis, show an independent and original approach. For his apprenticeship Amman may have been in Basle or Zurich, but he probably spent some time in Paris or Lyon, since his early works show a close similarity to French book illustrations. In 1561 Amman settled in Nuremberg, where he worked with Virgil Solis. After Solis's death in 1562, Amman began a lifelong partnership with Solis's publisher, adapting himself to every task and changing his style according to his employer's demands. The era's most prolific book illustrator, Amman illustrated at least fifty books for him alone. These projects included biblical compositions, widely reprinted scenes of tradespeople, and an artists' instruction book; many served as pattern books for later artists. He also made ornamental designs and etchings, including over a hundred portraits for an aristocratic Nuremberg family. A pupil said that Amman's drawings from one four-year period would have filled a hay wagon. By 1581 Amman was famous. He painted the Elector Ludwig VI on his deathbed in Heidelberg, designed the Würzburg University church portal, and taught drawing to an English earl. He also designed stained glass and jewelry. Still he lived in constant poverty. Shortly before his death, knowing that estate taxes would bankrupt his family, he plead with rich relatives in Zurich for help. "

Until about the end of the century he painted mainly anecdotal genre scenes in the manner of his brother-in-law George Morland, but he then turned to the paintings of animals in landscape settings for which he is remembered. They are often dramatic and Romantic in character and their rich colouring was influenced by Rubens (Bulls Fighting, Victoria and Albert Museum, London, c. 1804). His taste for natural grandeur and the Sublime often led him to work on a large scale, as in the enormous Gordale Scar (Tate Gallery, London, 1811-15). Ward had many admirers, including Delacroix and Géricault, but he lived in retirement from the 1830s and ended his life in poverty. His brother William (1766-1826) was an engraver. "

His large prints depicting the buildings of classical and postclassical Rome and its vicinity contributed considerably to Rome's fame and to the growth of classical archaeology and to the Neoclassical movement in art. At the age of 20 Piranesi went to Rome as a draftsman for the Venetian ambassador. He studied with leading printmakers of the day and settled permanently in Rome in 1745. It was during this period that he developed his highly original etching technique, producing rich textures and bold contrasts of light and shadow by means of intricate, repeated bitings of the copperplate. He created about 2,000 plates in his lifetime. The Prisons (Carceri) of about 1745 are his finest early prints; they depict ancient Roman or Baroque ruins converted into fantastic, visionary dungeons filled with mysterious scaffolding and instruments of torture. Among his best mature prints are the series Le Antichità romane (1756; Roman Antiquities), the Vedute di Roma (Views of Rome; appearing as single prints between 1748 and 1778), and the views of the Greek temples at Paestum (1777-78). His unparalleled accuracy of depiction, his personal expression of the structures' dramatic and romantic grandeur, and his technical mastery made these prints some of the most original and impressive representations of architecture to be found in Western art.

34692,Hendrick Goltzius,1558,1617,"Dutch graphic artist and painter of German descent, the outstanding line engraver of his time. He was the leader of a group of Mannerist artists who worked in Haarlem, where he founded some kind of 'academy' with  Cornelis van Haarlem and Karel van Mander. Goltzius was born in 1558 in Muhlbracht, present-day Bracht-am-Niederrhein. Called 'a fat, wild, and lively child' by Van Mander, Goltzius fell into a fire when he was about a year old, after which he was never able to fully open his right hand, the one he would nevertheless use to draw, engrave, and paint. Recognising Hendrick's artistic interest and ability, his father, Jan Goltz II, removed his son from school at age eight and allowed him to study drawing and glass painting, his own profession. About 1575 Goltzius was apprenticed to learn the art of engraving from the exiled polemicist and engraver Dirck Volkertsz Coornhert. In 1577 Goltzius joined Coornhert in Haarlem, where Goltzius settled permanently. In 1579, Goltzius married Margaretha Jansdr, a widow, and became step-father to Jacob Matham who would follow in Goltzius's footsteps as a printmaker. After working for the Antwerp-based publisher Philips Galle for a few years, Goltzius in 1582 began to publish his own engravings. By 1585 Goltzius was working in the idealised international style now known as Mannerism. This flamboyant mode of representation had been introduced to Haarlem in 1583 when Van Mander settled there and brought with him drawings by the Flemish artist Bartholomeus Spranger, whom he had met and worked with in Italy and Vienna in the mid-1570s. Goltzius engraved a number of Spranger's compositions, and his own designs also began to derive inspiration from this aesthetic. With their calculated extremes of anatomical excess and distortion, intentionally ambiguous definition of space, and an all-encompassing devotion to surface ornamentation, Goltzius's engravings from this period, 1585 to 1590, epitomise the conscious avoidance of naturalism and the deliberate over-refinement of this anti-classical approach. By decade's end a lessening of his 'Sprangerism' is evident in Goltzius's engravings and drawings, a tendency that was reinforced by his journey to Italy. In January 1591, he arrived in Rome, where he sketched after Raphael, Michelangelo, and Polidoro da Caravaggio, and to an even greater degree from antiquities. Goltzius's colourful portrait drawings made on his way to and from Italy are of great beauty and significance as well. He returned to Haarlem by the end of 1591. With the assistance of his many followers, Goltzius throughout the 1590s experienced much success as an engraver and publisher, and his activity with chiaroscuro woodcuts was of consequence as well. By 1600 he enjoyed a far-reaching reputation as Europe's pre-eminent graphic artist. Around the outset of the new century Goltzius created what are perhaps his most extraordinary works of art, his 'Pen-wercken' on large parchments and prepared canvases. Goltzius's landscape studies of the environs of Haarlem drawn about this time demonstrate that he played a decisive role in the development of the seventeenth-century Dutch realist tradition. Also in or around 1600 the artist exchanged burin for brush and became a painter, a pursuit he followed until his death on New Year's Day 1617. While vestiges of Goltzius's Mannerist past are to be seen in some of his paintings, in particular certain of his early endeavours in this domain, the influences of his Italian sojourn, his ongoing activity with drawing from live models, as well as the critical impetus derived in 1612 from contact with Rubens during his visit to Haarlem, resulted in his painted coppers, panels, and canvases assuming a more classicising idiom.

40479,Cecco Bravo,1607,1661,"Italian painter and draughtsman, originally Francesco Montelatici. Late 20th-century scholarship has nominated him the most original and exploratory Florentine painter of the 17th century. He learnt the fundamentals of his drawing technique from Giovanni Bilivert and was also close to Sigismondo Coccapani (1583-1642). In the early 1620s he took part in the vast collective projects carried out under the direction of Matteo Rosselli and by 1629 was the head of a workshop. His first recorded works, the fresco of the Virgin, St John and Angels (c. 1628/9; Florence, San Marco) and Charity (Florence, Santissima Annunziata), show his close study of the Florentine tradition from Andrea del Sarto to Pontormo. In 1633 he painted six lunettes with scenes from the Life of the Blessed Bonaventura Bonaccorsi (Pistoia, Santissima Annunziata), continuing a series begun in 1601 by Bernardino Poccetti but with a livelier rhythm. The vein of caricature in these paintings appears more strongly in the frieze depicting Children's Games (c. 1631; Impruneta, Villa Mezzamonte). His depiction of illustrious Tuscans (1636; Florence, Casa Buonarroti), later completed by Domenico Pugliani and Rosselli, shows a particular sensitivity to landscape, built up with rapid brushstrokes in an almost Impressionistic manner. He was commissioned to complete work initiated by Giovanni da San Giovanni (who died after starting) for the Sala degli Argenti in Palazzo Pitti, in a commission shared with Ottavio Vannini and Francesco Furini. The frescoes, intended to celebrate Lorenzo de' Medici, were commissioned in 1635 by Ferdinando II de' Medici prior to his marriage to the daughter of the Duke of Urbino. In the south wall, Bravo completed Lorenzo as messenger of peace. In 1659, Cecco was recommended by the Cardinal Leopoldo de' Medici for a position as a court painter to Anna, wife of the archduke of Ferdinand Karl of the Tyrol. He accepted and spent the last two years of his life in Innsbruck. "

In the artistic milieu of Hamburg, Nerly soon became the protégé of the artist, writer and patron Baron Carl Friedrich von Rumohr (1785-1843), who encouraged the young artist's talent for observing nature. In 1827, patron and pupil undertook extensive travels throughout Germany, and during a visit to Weimar, Nerly made the acquaintance of Goethe. The following year saw Nerly's first trip to Italy, where he was to spend six years in Rome, working within a well-established community of German artists. Nerly's landscape studies of Rome and the surrounding areas, as well as of Naples and Southern Italy, were much admired by his peers, and rate among the best of German realistic landscape art of the period. Nerly settled in Venice in 1835 and soon Italianised his name. He set up a studio, and soon gained a reputation as one of the finest vedute painters of the age, producing numerous views of the city, which were in high demand among educated travellers. He frequently produced multiple versions of compositions, including thirty-six views of the Piazzetta. Following his death in 1878, the remains of Nerly's artistic estate were gifted to the city of his birth, where it is now housed by the Angermuseum. His son Friedrich Nerly the Younger was a landscape painter, born in Venice and active in Italy. "

41004,James Seymour,1702,1752,"English painter and draughtsman. The son of James Seymour (d. 1739), a dealer in pictures and precious metals, Seymour was among the first English painters to specialize exclusively in sporting subject-matter. Though he possibly received some informal drawing instruction from the topographer Francis Place, Seymour was essentially a self-taught artist whose education was based on the study of pictures that passed through his father's hands; one of his earliest known works is a sketch of a horse's head after van Dyck. His early 'genius to drawing of horses' was, according to George Vertue, compromised by 'modish extravagances' through living 'gay high and loosely' and because he 'never studied enough to paint or colour well'. Elsewhere, however, it was recorded that by 1739 he was 'reckoned the finest draughtsman in his way [of horses, hounds etc.] in the whole world' (Universal Spectator, 1739), and he was certainly preferred to his chief rival, John Wootton, by many sporting patrons. Though many of his paintings are either derivative of Wootton or simply inept, or both, others are characterized by a self-conscious stylistic naivety in which meticulous attention to detail and eerily static compositions combine to create curiously memorable images of some apparent sophistication. Seymour had at least one pupil, Thomas Spencer (1710-1756), and many followers. His works were widely reproduced. "

He trained first with Matteo Ponzoni, then with Sebastiano Mazzoni; Mazzoni encouraged the development of a Baroque style, but Celesti was also attracted by the naturalism of the tenebrists. The first known works by Celesti are mature in style, and he had already achieved considerable fame in Venice when the Doge Alvise Contarini honoured him with the title of Cavaliere in 1681. The complexity of his sources is evident in two canvases, Moses Destroying the Golden Calf and Moses Chastising the Hebrew People for their Idolatry, both painted c. 1681 for the Palazzo Ducale, Venice, and signed Cavaliere; they are influenced by Luca Giordano and by the narrative techniques of Jacopo Tintoretto. The most distinguished works of Celesti's early period are two large lunettes that show three scenes: Benedict III Visiting St Zacharias, A Doge Presented with the Body of a Saint, and the Virtues Surrounding a Doge Holding the Model of St Zacharias (c. 1684; Venice, S Zaccaria). These luxuriant compositions represent a remarkable leap in quality from the paintings of the Palazzo Ducale, with lighter colours and a more flickering touch. A little later Celesti left Venice for Brescia, perhaps by way of Rovigo; exactly when he arrived is not known, but he established himself and his studio there for several years. Panfilo Nuvolone and Francesco Paglia (1636-1713) had encouraged the development of a more exuberant Baroque style in Brescia, and in response Celesti created more decorative, lyrical works, such as his ecstatic St Rose of Lima (Brescia, S Clemente) with its brilliant display of glorious light. Most of Celesti's paintings done in and around Brescia were religious canvases, but he also painted portraits, such as the two entitled Condottiero (Ljubljana, Slovenian Academy of Sciences and Arts) and the portrait of Conte Alberto di Baone (Dublin, National Gallery), executed in a dazzling array of colours. In 1688 Celesti was active at Toscolano on Lake Garda, where he painted canvases of scenes from the Life of St Peter (Toscolano Cathedral) and in 1689 decorated the salone of the Palazzo Delay (now Palazzo Mafizzoli) with Old Testament scenes. In 1696 he was at Treviso, where he executed a Last Judgement for the cathedral (untraced) and in 1697, 1698 and 1699 pictures for the abbey of S Floriano at Linz, where his Paradise, for the high altar, remains in situ. By 1700 Celesti was back in Venice, where he set up his studio; Venetian artists of this period, led by Giovanni Coli and Filippo Gherardi, were reviving the style of Veronese, and Celesti, following this trend, produced late works that employed more dazzling effects of colour and light. These works include the frescoed decoration of the Villa Rinaldi Barbini at Casella d'Asolo, where Celesti created a series of exotic and theatrical mythological and biblical scenes, distinguished by their luminosity and by their light and airy touch. His last works were three dramatic night scenes: the Birth of the Virgin, the Assumption of the Virgin and the Martyrdom of St Lawrence (1706-11; Verolanuova Cathedral). Celesti was much admired by Charles-Nicholas Cochin and by Jean-Honoré Fragonard, and his colour influenced the Rococo art of the early 18th century in Venice and in Austria. "

Eglon painted landscapes as well as history pictures, portraits, and genre scenes, was more peripatetic and had greater financial success than his father. At the beginning of his career Eglon travelled in France where he worked for the Dutch governor of Orange. He returned to Amsterdam by 1659. From 1664 until 1679, Rotterdam was his base. Thereafter he spent a decade in Brussels. He was appointed court painter of Charles II of Spain in 1687; however, he apparently never made the trip to the king's court. In 1690 he accepted the post of court painter to the Elector Palatine, Johann Willhelm in Düsseldorf. Adriaen der Werff, Eglon's pupil, made contact with the Elector Palatine in 1696 and quickly became his favourite. However, Eglon continued to hold his position until his death in 1703. "

36343,Johann Christian Reinhart,1761,1847,"German painter and etcher. He was a son of Deacon Peter Johann Reinhart, who came from an old family of craftsmen, died quite early in 1764, so that Johann Christian and his brother Amandus were brought up by their mother. Johann Christian Reinhart attended Hof's grammar school where one of his teachers recognized the boy's talent for drawing and encouraged him in this. Like his father, Johann Christian started to study theology because life as an artist seemed too insecure. However he turned more and more to art and started to study under Adam Friedrich Oeser, the Director of the Art Academy in Leipzig. In 1783 he moved to Dresden to further his studies. He concentrated on landscape painting which was to form the main body of his work as an artist. In 1784 he returned to Leipzig, where he got to know Friedrich Schiller in 1785. This friendship lasted all his life. From 1786 he spent three years in Meiningen (Thuringia) at the court of Duke Georg of Meinigen, one of the centres of classicism next to Jena and Weimar. Supported by the hereditary Prince of Coburg-Gotha, he got a grant from the Margrave of Ansbach-Bayreuth which enabled him to go to Italy. In December 1789 he reached Rome, a gathering place for artists at the time. From there, he travelled all over Italy. In 1801 he married an Italian, Anna Caffo and together they had three children. Paintings, drawings and etchings, of which he made many prints, brought him artistic recognition and financial success. In 1839 he was appointed official court painter in Bavaria. "
64833,Léonard Limosin,1500,1577,"Léonard Limosin (also Limousin), French enameller, etcher, painter and miniature painter, the most accomplished member of one of the best-known families of enamellers working in Limoges during the 16th century. He was the best-known enameller of Renaissance France and may have learnt that trade in the Pénicaud workshop in Limoges. Encouraged by the Bishop of Limoges, Jean de Langeac, who probably put him in touch with the court of Francis I, Limosin produced painted enamels on copper in all forms, including plates and plaques with mythological and religious subjects, tableware and caskets. His chief speciality was the interpretation in enamels of portrait drawings by artists of the school of Jean and François Clouet, such as that of Anne de Montmorency (Paris, Louvre). His early works were influenced by German Renaissance art; in fact, his earliest authenticated work (1532) is a series of 18 enamel plaques of the 'Passion of the Lord,' after a series of prints by the German artist Albrecht Dürer. This Germanic influence was later counterbalanced by that of Francesco Primaticcio, Rosso Fiorentino, Giulio Romano, and Antonio Solario, Italian Mannerist painters who worked for Francis I in the mid-16th century on decorating the royal château of Fontainebleau. In 1530 Limosin entered the service of Francis I as painter and valet de chambre, a position he retained under Henry II. For both monarchs he produced many finely characterized portraits in enamel, among them enamel plaques depicting Henry's mistress Diane de Poitiers in various poses and characters. He executed many plates, vases, ewers, and cups, as well as decorative paintings. Although Limosin is best known for his richly coloured enamels, as well as his use of grisaille enamel (monochromatic enamel painting to give the illusion of sculpture), he was also an accomplished oil painter who acquired a great reputation in his day. His last signed works bear the date 1574. The most renowned of Limosin's 2,000 enamels that are not portraits are two votive tablets with 23 plaques each that he made in 1553 for the Sainte-Chapelle in Paris. "

19396,Joseph Nollekens,1737,1823,"Neoclassical sculptor whose busts made him the most fashionable English portrait sculptor of his day. He came from an artistic family originally from Antwerp. His father and grandfather were painters. At 13 Nollekens entered the studio of the noted sculptor of tombs and busts Peter Scheemakers, from whom Nollekens learned to appreciate the sculpture of antiquity. In 1760 he went to Rome, where David Garrick and Laurence Sterne were among the English visitors who sat for him. After his return to England in 1770 he became a member of the Royal Academy (1772) and was patronized by George III. Among his famous likenesses are those of George III, William Pitt, Charles James Fox, and Benjamin West. Many of his works were influenced by ancient Roman busts of the late Republic style. He personally preferred sculpturing mythological works based on ancient prototypes, especially genteel but erotic Venuses delicately modeled in an almost Rococo manner. "
34811,Frans Hals,1575,1666,"Frans Hals was the great 17th-century portraitist of the Dutch bourgeoisie of Haarlem, where he spent practically all his life. Hals evolved a technique that was close to impressionism in its looseness, and he painted with increasing freedom as he grew older. The jovial spirit of his early work is typified by the Shrovetide Revellers (Merry Company, c. 1615; Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York). In middle age his portraits grew increasingly sad, revealing sometimes a sense of foreboding (e.g., Nicolaes Hasselaer, 1630-33; Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam). The paintings of his old age show best his genius for portraying character (e.g., Man in a Slouch Hat, 1660-66; Staatliche Museen, Kassel). Early life and works Frans Hals left no written evidence about his life or his works, and only a brief outline of his biography is known. He was the son of a clothworker from Mechelen (Malines) and of a local girl, and the family moved from Spanish-held Flanders to Haarlem in the free Netherlands by 1591 at the latest; the local townhall records give this date for the christening of Frans's younger brother Dirck, who also became a painter. Except for a brief visit to Antwerp in 1616, Hals lived all his life in Haarlem. What he did for the first 25 or 30 years of his life is not known. The earliest indication of his activity as an artist was that about 1610 he joined the Guild of St Luke of Haarlem, a body empowered to register artists as masters. Shortly afterward he married his first wife, Annetje Harmensdochter Abeel. She bore him two children before her death in 1615. Two years later, Hals married Lysbeth Reyniers, who was to survive her husband by some nine years. In all, Hals had 10 children, and 5 of his 8 sons became painters. None, however, was of note. Tradition has it that Frans Hals was the pupil of Carel van Mander, a minor painter and poet who helped found a successful painting academy at Haarlem. There is no evidence either to support this claim or to refute it. From the beginning, however, Hals's work conflicted with the typical mannerisms of his presumed master. His early work is actually closer in spirit to that of Jacob Jordaens, who was an outstanding Baroque painter from Antwerp and a pupil of Peter Paul Rubens. The good humour of Hals's popular scenes recalls the joyous gatherings painted by the contemporary Dutch followers of the earthy, sensuous Italian painter Caravaggio. Frans Hals seems, from the evidence of extant works, to have begun his career with sober portraits and with group portraits of members of the local guilds and military societies. The best of these early works - which already shows complete competence in portraiture - is a monumental painting entitled Banquet of Officers of the Civic Guard of St. George at Haarlem (1616; Frans Halsmuseum, Haarlem), painted with a loose brushstroke technique that is unlike anything else in Dutch art of the time. It already has a sense of life and of relationship between the figures that was then unknown in this type of subject matter. By about 1620, however, Hals had begun to introduce into his paintings the jovial spirit that characterized his early works and that portrays with accuracy and enthusiasm one important aspect traditionally ascribed to Dutch character. Many of his portraits are simply pictures of merrymakers. The portrait of Hans Wurst in The Merry Company shows the sitter in a tall, wide-brimmed hat, wearing a necklace made of pig's feet, herrings, and eggs. The portrait of Mr. Verdonck (c. 1627) shows the subject joyfully brandishing the jawbone of a horse. Similar in spirit are the portrait of Peeckelhaering (c. 1628-30) clenching his beer mug, The Merry Drinker, and two later portraits, a picture entitled Malle Babbe (1633-35; Staatliche Museen, Berlin), which portrays an old madwoman laughing, with an owl perched on her shoulder, and a joyful picture in the Louvre Museum of a laughing, carelessly dressed Gypsy Girl (1628-30). In Hals's group portraits, too, the spontaneous joie de vivre that is evident in the individual portraits is felt to a degree that revolutionizes the hitherto austere genre. One such painting is his second Banquet of Officers of the Civic Guard of St George at Haarlem (1627; Frans Halsmuseum), in which the figures take up postures normally employed for the expression of mystical religious rapture to celebrate their well-nourished contentment. In this painting, Hals displays his unmistakable genius for mise-en-scène; the dramatic effects he achieves here set him apart from most other painters. His militiamen are linked in a harmonious composition that makes the viewer aware of the cohesion of their group as a whole. Each conducts a dialogue with his neighbour, and here and there one figure is made purposely to disrupt the scheme with a gesture or a glance in the viewer's direction. Nothing is happening except a meal shared by typical members of the Dutch middle class and their conversations. Yet there is a majesty to this scene that is equal to any depiction of an incident from the life of a king. This painting also hints at the sense of mysterious spirituality, which, fostered by the artist's intimate knowledge of his subjects, came with his maturity to thread its way into his absolute realism. By the 1620s Hals had definitively evolved a technique that was close to impressionism in its looseness. Like the contemporary Spanish painter Diego Velázquez, he used colour to structure forms; and this use of colour is what sets the two artists apart from their contemporaries. Unique to Hals, however, is his use of quick, loose strokes of bright colour that suggest rather than enclose form and are highly expressive of movement and of the subjects' vitality. Most painters of the 17th century approached their paintings slowly, with preparatory drawings, a certain amount of underpainting, and an elaborate finish. Although there is no certain evidence of his method, Hals seems to have started directly on the canvas and painted quickly, leaving his first spontaneous expression, which is almost an oil sketch, as the finished work. Hals continued to use this technique, which gave a striking immediacy to his perceptive portrayals of character, all his life, painting with increasing freedom as he grew older. It has often been suggested that Frans Hals's life resembled the lives of the bon vivants he portrayed at the beginning of his career. It is true that from 1616 he began to incur claims from creditors, and he was in financial difficulties most of his life. He belonged, however, to the Haarlem St George militia company and was a member of the Haarlem De Wijngaertranken (""Society of Rhetoricians"") in 1618-19; both of these facts are quite inconsistent with the romantic picture of dissipation that traditionally has been associated with the painter. Moreover, the stern preachers and theologians, the high-ranking officials, the surgeons, the admirals, the writers, and the respectable shopkeepers whose portraits Hals painted in great numbers were not likely to have posed for a dissolute person. Later life and works At any rate, the joviality began to disappear from the paintings of Hals's middle age. In the portraits painted after he reached the age of 40, the subjects seem to eye the world knowingly, with a shade of sadness in their faces. The earliest portrait that strongly shows this quality is Man with Arms Crossed (1622). Others follow that contain the same theme: The Laughing Cavalier (1624; Wallace Collection, London), Portrait of Isaac Abrahamszoon Massa (1626; Art Gallery of Ontario, Toronto), Pieter van den Broecke (1633), Nicolaes Hasselaer, Willem van Heythuyzen (c. 1637-39; Royal Museum of Fine Arts, Brussels), and Daniel van Aken Playing the Violin (c. 1640; National Museum, Stockholm). These portraits seem to reveal a sense of foreboding; still, their mood ranges somewhere above the midpoint in the ""human comedy."" The period from 1630 to 1650 was Hals's most productive. He was very popular among the staid citizens of Haarlem's middle class, and during this time he painted more than 100 single portraits and 6 group and family portraits. Frans Hals lived to be very old, and it is in the paintings of his old age that his genius for portraying human character is fully revealed. The last years of his life were difficult materially, and he was harassed by discouraging family problems. Although he continued to work steadily, he received markedly fewer commissions after 1650. He had, during his long career, achieved an impressive reputation; he had been honoured by many important commissions, had become in 1644 an officer of the Guild of St Luke, and in 1649 had painted the philosopher René Descartes. Still, although some continued to value his subtle perceptions, the public had generally begun to favour a more elegant style made popular by the portrait painter Anthony Van Dyck in England. What commissions he did receive were not enough to support him, and, like his two great compatriots Rembrandt and Vermeer, he saw his possessions sold at auction for debt (1654). It was not until 1662 that his right to public assistance was recognized, and he was accorded a yearly pension by the city. In spite of this adversity the portraits of Hals's last 16 years are his masterpieces. At this point, a view of the world is revealed in his painting in which the human comedy takes a tragic turn, and something breaks in the order that had kept the reasonable man and the madman separated. His portraits, no longer tempered by laughter, seem to express a realization that simply being is enough, after a certain age, for life to impress its tragic seal. Henceforth, Hals drew gradually closer to traditional subjects and stored away his drinking glasses and his tableware. At the same time he diminished the intensity, the vividness of his themes, a greater simplicity appeared in his compositions, and he took more and more liberty with his painting. His palette lost a good deal of its lustre. But through decades of work he had evolved a remarkably broad range of blacks and whites to choose from, and these colours were sufficient for what he wanted to show. From 1650 on, his subjects begin almost to look awestruck, and Hals ceases to bind his compositions into powerfully articulated human masses. Instead, he strings the solitude of each figure together on a flimsy thread, with the pattern broken only here and there by some ultimate spark of vitality. The light seems to act as a nervous system in his subjects that whips their drowsy flesh back to life, and the magic of the brushwork seems to startle their faces out of a swoonlike slumber. In the two celebrated portraits of the ""Governors of the Old Men's Home at Haarlem"" (both 1664; Frans Halsmuseum), one a group of old men and the other of old women, his men seem overcome with drunkenness and his women entranced by the obsession of death. Here he presents us with the most extraordinary reunion of senile decay ever assembled in the history of the pictorial arts; he shows us the quavering flame of dying life. It is not known whether these portraits were comprehensible to his models. Apparently, none of the regents of the home objected to the paintings hanging in their Hall of Honour. Perhaps his subjects shared the old painter's humility in the face of destiny. Thus, the harmony in the colourful blare of the early works came to be succeeded by an art that seemed to give form to elusive nervous twitches, sudden motions, and to heartbeats accelerating, only to falter and start again. All his life Frans Hals had acted as a lucid observer of Haarlem. He painted it in the loud mirth of youth, and, reflecting in the image that he made of it his own life and declining health, he remained its faithful companion until his death. Old age fostered self-denial and a strict discipline in Hals, along with a new freedom in his painting. It most certainly was a painful time for the great painter. But the years had also sharpened his vision. There is no sign of religion in the evolution of his art; and it may be assumed that to Frans Hals, painting was a secular concern. Nevertheless, the loving compassion that permeated his art becomes, in his last years, something spiritual. Like many artists whose style is unique in their own time, he left few direct followers; the closest was Adriaen Brouwer, who used Hals's techniques well to portray tavern scenes and similar subjects. Hals was for a long time regarded as a competent but limited painter whose consistent neglect of any subjects other than portraits gave him no place in the history of significant art. It was not until the 19th century that interest in his work was revived. He influenced Édouard Manet with his free style and Vincent van Gogh with his subtle range of colours. In modern times he has been appreciated for the serious and excellent realist painter that he was. "
41911,Lucas van Leyden,1494,1533,"Lucas Van Leyden (real name Lucas Hugensz or Jacobsz.), Netherlandish engraver and painter,  born and mainly active in Leiden, who was among the first Dutch exponents of genre painting and is generally regarded as one of the finest engravers in the history of art. He was the pupil of his father, from whose hand no works are known, and of Cornelis Engebrechtsz., but both of these were painters whereas Lucas himself was principally an engraver. Where he learnt engraving is unknown, but he was highly skilled in that art at a very early age: the earliest known print by him (Mohammed and the Murdered Monk) dates from 1508, when he was perhaps only 14, yet reveals no trace of immaturity in inspiration or technique. In 1514 he entered the Painters' Guild at Leiden. He seems to have travelled a certain amount, and visits are recorded to Antwerp in 1521, the year of Dürer's Netherlandish journey, and to Middelburg in 1527, when he met Gossart. An unbroken series of dated engravings makes it possible to follow his career as a print-maker and to date many of his paintings, but no clear pattern of stylistic development emerges. Dürer was the single greatest influence on him, but Lucas was less intellectual in his approach, tending to concentrate on the anecdotal features of the subject and to take delight in caricatures and genre motifs. Van Mander characterizes Lucas as a pleasure-loving dilettante, who sometimes worked in bed, but he left a large oeuvre, in spite of his fairly early death, and must have been a prodigious worker. Lucas had a great reputation in his day (Vasari even rated him above Dürer) and is universally regarded as one of the greatest figures in the history of graphic art (he made etchings and woodcuts as well as engravings and was a prolific draughtsman). His status as a painter is less elevated, but he was undoubtedly one of the outstanding Netherlandish painters of his period. He was a pioneer of the Netherlandish genre tradition, as witness his Chess Players (Staatliche Museen, Berlin) which actually represents a variant game called 'courier' - and his Card Players (National Gallery of Art, Washington), while his celebrated Last Judgement triptych (Lakenhal Museum, Leiden, 1526-27) shows the heights to which he could rise as a religious painter. It eloquently displays his vivid imaginative powers, his marvellous skill as a colourist and his deft and fluid brushwork. Lucas left no pupils or direct followers, but his work was a stimulus to an even greater Leiden-born artist, Rembrandt. "

4263,George Catlin,1796,1872,"American painter, traveler and writer. Following a brief career as a lawyer, he produced two major collections of paintings of American Indians and published a series of books chronicling his travels among the native peoples of North, Central and South America. Claiming his interest in America's 'vanishing race' was sparked by a visiting American Indian delegation in Philadelphia, he set out to record the appearance and customs of America's native people. He began his journey in 1830 when he accompanied General William Clark on a diplomatic mission up the Mississippi River into Native American territory. Two years later he ascended the Missouri River over 3000 km to Ft Union, where he spent several weeks among indigenous people still relatively untouched by European civilization. There, at the edge of the frontier, he produced the most vivid and penetrating portraits of his career. Later trips along the Arkansas, Red and Mississippi rivers as well as visits to Florida and the Great Lakes resulted in over 500 paintings and a substantial collection of artefacts. In 1837 he mounted the first serious exhibition of his 'Indian Gallery', published his first catalogue and began delivering public lectures, which drew on his personal recollections of life among the American Indians. Soon afterwards he began a lifelong effort to sell his American Indian collection to the US government. When Congress rejected his initial petition, he took the Indian Gallery abroad and in 1840 began a European tour in London. In 1841 he published Manners, Customs, and Condition of the North American Indians, in two volumes, with about 300 engravings. Three years later he published 25 plates, entitled Catlin's North American Indian Portfolio, and, in 1848, Eight Years' Travels and Residence in Europe. From 1852 to 1857 he traveled through South and Central America and later returned for further exploration in the Far West. The record of these later years is contained in Last Rambles amongst the Indians of the Rocky Mountains and the Andes (1868) and My Life among the Indians (ed. by N. G. Humphreys, 1909). Of his 470 full-length portraits of Native American scenes, the greater part constitutes the Catlin Gallery of the National Museum, Washington, D.C.; some 700 sketches are in the American Museum of Natural History, New York City. His observations of the Native Americans have been questioned as to accuracy. He was the first white man to see the Minnesota pipestone quarries, and pipestone is also called catlinite. "

40984,Carlo Marchionni,1702,1786,"Italian architect, sculptor, and draftsman. Marchionni's early career was fostered by his lifelong friend Cardinal Alessandro Albani, a great collector of antiquities. His mature style exhibits a richly-detailed idiomatic repertory on the cusp of Late Baroque and Neoclassicism that may be compared with the similar style by his Italian contemporaries Alessandro Galilei, Ferdinando Fuga or Vanvitelli, or indeed with their French contemporary, Ange-Jacques Gabriel. Marchionni's earliest training was as a sculptor. He studied architecture at Rome's Accademia di San Luca, as pupil of Filippo Barigioni (1690-1753), who favoured the elaborated style of Borromini. In 1728 Marchionni had come to Albani's attention after winning first prize in the Academy's Concorso Clementino. Marchionni's Borromini-influenced style is identifiable in Marchionni's early work (1728) for Cardinal Albani's villa at Anzio and at the papal retreat of Castel Gandolfo. Marchionni helped restore and rebuild the choir at San Giovanni in Laterano along with Giovanni Battista Piranesi, whose picturesque approach to Roman antiquity likely influenced Marchionni's style. However, Marchionni's mature work, such as the Villa Albani (1746-63) expresses the courtly decorative classicism of his patron's circle, which included the neoclassicist Winckelmann, curator of Albani's antiquities. After Niccolò Salvi's death in 1751, Marchionni help design the Villa's garden façade. Marchionni was appointed papal architect and overseer of works at St Peter's Basilica by Pope Benedict XIV. In 1766, the pope commissioned Marchionni to rebuild the entrance façade of the Museo Profano, the papal collection of antiquities originally displayed by Bramante in the Braccia Nuova of the Vatican, along one side of the Cortile del Belvedere. Two commissions from Pope Pius VI constituted Marchionni's last official Roman projects. One was the new sacristy for St Peter's (1776-84), which had been envisaged by the preceding pontiff, who demolished the mausoleum dedicated to the Madonna of the Fevers that stood on its site. The project was preceded by a public competition. The imposing Sacristy, an independent building as large as a church, is sited in the angle of the left transept. It consists of the octagonal Sagrestia Comune, the Sacristy of the Canons, and the Sala of the Chapter. It is connected to the basilica by raised galleries in which Marchionni inserted fragments of Roman bas reliefs. Marchionni also designed church furnishings, such as the high altar and rich tabernacle of Santa Caterina a Magnanapoli (1787). Cardinal Albani commissioned from Marchionni the funerary monument (1737-39) located in Santa Maria sopra Minerva, with sculpture by his frequent collaborator Pietro Bracci, to honour Pope Benedict XIII. Outside Rome, Cardinal Albani commissioned a façade for the collegiate church at Nettuno (1734). He received papal commissions for the churches of San Domenico in Ancona (from 1763) and Santa Maddalena de Cassinessi in Messina (from 1765). As an engineer, he was responsible for work in the port of Ancona overseen by Luigi Vanvitelli. Throughout his career his scenographic talents were called upon for the temporary decorations required for public events, which are documented in preparatory drawings or presentation drawings. The developing Neoclassicism soon dismissed Marchionni's conservative classicised Baroque style. "

4326,Jules Chéret,1836,1932,"French lithographer, poster designer and painter. Chéret's formal training in art was limited to a course at the Ecole Nationale de Dessin, Paris, as a pupil of Horace Lecoq de Boisbaudran (1802-1897). More important for his future as a poster artist were his apprenticeships with lithographers from the age of 13. He created his first poster, Orpheus in the Underworld, for the composer Jacques Offenbach in 1858; this, however, did not lead to further commissions, and he went to London where he designed book covers for the publishing firm of Cramer as well as several posters for the circus, theatre and music halls. These efforts led him to work for the perfume manufacturer Eugène Rimmel, who in 1866 supported Chéret's establishment of a commercial colour lithographic shop in Paris. First working in one or two colours, in 1869 Chéret introduced a new system of printing from three stones: one black, one red and the third a 'fond gradué' (graduated background, achieved by printing two colours from one stone, with cool colours at the top and warm colours at the bottom). This process was the basis of his colour lithographic posters throughout the 1870s and early 1880s; later, when the format of posters had grown to life-size, his colour schemes became much more elaborate and varied. By 1881 his work had become so popular, and he had become so financially successful, that he was able to transfer the responsibility of his shop to Chaix & Company while maintaining artistic control. Chéret's reputation as the father of the colour lithographic poster was grounded in his innovative use of lithography for posters. He created over a thousand poster designs promoting a great variety of products, performances, theatres, nightclubs, journals, exhibitions and books, as well as lithographic book covers, illustrations and, in 1891, four works described as decorative posters, which advertised no products but were framed and hung like paintings. Among his most important early works are the poster produced in 1874 for the dance hall Frascati (his first large-scale work) and Les Girard (1877), whose integration of text with image makes it one of the most stylistically advanced posters of the 19th century. His posters of the 1890s include Saxoléine and Palais de Glace, both of which typify Chéret's romantic vision of fin-de-siècle women (the 'chérettes', as they came to be called), while Bal au Moulin Rouge (1889) and Loie Fuller (1893) precede and relate directly to the same subjects of his younger colleague Toulouse-Lautrec. While Chéret's greatest contribution is in poster art, he also produced paintings, pastels and murals. From 1898 he worked on murals for the Hôtel de Ville, Paris, for the Exposition Universelle of 1900 (completed in 1903). Chéret's murals, like his posters, reveal the strong influence of the Rococo aesthetics of Antoine Watteau and Jean-Honoré Fragonard and the paintings of Giambattista Tiepolo. It was this 18th-century style that separated Chéret from his younger colleagues; nevertheless, his influence on them in subject matter, in medium and in the use of art within the advertising world was substantial. He inspired a younger generation of artists, including among many others Pierre Bonnard, Toulouse-Lautrec, Théophile-Alexandre Steinlen and Alphonse Mucha, to create posters in the 1890s. "

392,Cherubino Alberti,1553,1615,"Italian painter and printmaker, part of a family of artists, brother of Alessandro and Giovanni Alberti. The best known of the three sons of Alberto Alberti, he distinguished himself as a printmaker at an early age. One of his earliest prints, an etching of the Virgin and Child (1568) shows his interest in Raphael as well as in contemporary Mannerist art. In Rome he studied with Cornelis Cort, whose swelling burin line he adopted to create pictorial effects of strong chiaroscuro. Between 1571 and 1575 he made several prints after Federico Zuccaro and Taddeo Zuccaro. During the next ten years he reached the height of his fame as a printmaker, producing engravings after Raphael, Michelangelo, Polidoro da Caravaggio and of ancient statues. His prints of Polidoro are particularly valued as documents of lost works. He also made prints from paintings by Andrea del Sarto, Rosso Fiorentino, Marco Pino, Pellegrino Tibaldi and Cristofano Gherardi. He made numerous original engravings, among them an Angel Supporting the Body of Christ, which exemplifies his concern with graceful postures and ornamental draperies. In his later years he designed elaborate presentation prints, such as a portrait of Henry IV of France in an ornamental cartouche (B. 248) and a large Adoration of the Shepherds for Pope Clement VIII. His oeuvre includes over 180 prints. "

He was the son of the painter Étienne de La Hyre (c. 1583-1643) but was most influenced by the work of Georges Lallemant and Orazio Gentileschi. His picture of Pope Nicolas V at the Tomb of Saint Francis was done in 1630 for the Capuchins, for whom he executed several other works. For the goldsmiths' company he produced in 1635 St Peter Healing the Sick and the Conversion of St Paul in 1637. In 1648, with 11 other artists, he helped found the French Royal Academy. Cardinal Richelieu called him to the Palais-Royal about 1640 to paint decorative mythological scenes, and he later designed a series of tapestries for the Gobelins. "

33680,Giovanni Boldini,1842,1931,"Italian portrait painter and printmaker. Having worked in Florence and London, he reached his peak of creativity and success in Paris. He received his earliest training from his father, the painter Antonio Boldini (1799-1872). From 1858 he may have attended courses given by Girolamo Domenichini (1813-91) and Giovanni Pagliarini (1809-78) at the Civico Ateneo di Palazzo dei Diamanti, where he assiduously copied Old Masters. At 18 he was already known in Ferrara as an accomplished portrait painter. In 1862 he went to Florence, where he sporadically attended the Scuola del Nudo at the Accademia di Belle Arti. He frequented the Caffé Michelangiolo, a meeting-place of progressive artists, where he came into contact with the Macchiaioli group of artists. He was in exile in London in 1871-72 where he specialized in portraits of the aristocracy. Back in Paris in 1872, he was in great demand as a portraitist for high society. His works were often of Parisian street scenes in pastel shades. He also produced pastels, drawings, and watercolours. "

33402,Albrecht Altdorfer,1475,1538,"German painter and graphic artist working in Regensburg, of which town he was a citizen from 1505 onwards, the leading artist, the guiding spirit of the so-called Danube School. His training is unknown, but his early work was influenced by Cranach and Dürer's art too was known to him through the woodcuts and engravings. Mingled with these German impresions was  a knowledge of the art of Mantegna, perhaps through the mediation of Michael Pacher. Yet in spite of these varied influences Altdorfer's style always remained personal. Most of his paintings are religious works, but he was one of the first artists to show an interest in landscape as an independent genre. He was the first European to paint forests, sunsets, and picturesque ruins, in which he represented man as part of nature, allied with trees, rocks, mountains, and clouds and often resembling them. In works such as the altar for St Florian near Linz (1518) or the Christ  Taking Leave of His Mother (National Gallery, London) he achieved a wonderful unity of mood  between action and landscape, and two pure landscape paintings (without any figures) by him are  known (National Gallery, London, and Alte Pinakothek, Munich). His patrons included the  emperor Maximilian and Louis X, Duke of Bavaria, for whom he painted the celebrated Battle of  Issos (Alte Pinakothek, Munich, 1529), which formed part of a large series of famous  battle-pieces from Classical antiquity. With its dazzling light effects, teeming figures, and brilliant  colours, it is one of the finest examples of Altdorfer's rich imaginative powers. The fantastic element that pervaded his paintings was also prominent in his drawings, most of which were done with black and white lines on brown or blue-gray paper. His engravings and woodcuts, usually miniatures, were distinguished by their playful imaginativeness, the most important being 40 plates entitled The Fall and Redemption of Man. In 1530 he began using the new medium of etching to produce nine landscapes and a series of fanciful tankards intended as work models for goldsmiths. From 1526 until his death Altdorfer was employed as town architect of Regensburg. No architectural work by him is known, but his interest in architecture and his skill in handling intricate  problems of perspective are demonstrated by his Birth of the Virgin (Alte Pinakothek, Munich).

Back in France, he became a pupil of Léon Cogniet (1794-1880) and Felix Brissot de Warville (1818-1892). He made etchings of the old Paris and presented them at the 1867 World Expo held in the capital. "

In 1653 he was back in Dordrecht, set up his studio and married Geertruyt Botland. The couple had twelve children. Shortly before his death, Bisschop was invited by the King of Denmark to become his court painter. Bol's influence is unmistakable in the strong contrasts between light and shade in Bisschop's paintings. He drew his inspiration for his domestic genre scenes from the work of Nicolaes Maes and Samuel van Hoogstraten. The three painters were unsurpassed in their accurate rendition of complex perspective. According to Houbraken, Bisschop was the first to paint carved trompe l'oeil wooden panels in such an ingenious way that they became quite popular. His pupils included his sons Jacobus (1658-1698) and Abraham. "

She was the wife of Félix Bracquemond (1833-1914), a printmaker, designer, painter and writer, and the mother of Pierre Bracquemond (1870-1926), a painter. After a difficult start in life, she began to study drawing at Étampes, near Paris. She took advice from Ingres but never received any formal teaching. Admitted to the Salon from 1857, she was commissioned by the State to copy pictures in the Louvre. There she met Félix Bracquemond in about 1867 and married him on 5 August 1869. She was involved in her husband's work for the Haviland Limoges factory and produced in particular several dishes and a wide panel of ceramic tiles entitled the Muses, shown at the Exposition Universelle in Paris in 1878; the sketch for this was shown at the Impressionist Exhibition of 1879 and was greatly admired by Degas. Originally very much influenced by Ingres and then by Alfred (Emile-Léopold) Stevens, her style of painting changed completely c. 1880 as a consequence of her admiration for Renoir and Monet and subsequently because of advice from Gauguin. The few pictures surviving from this period illustrate her conversion to a clearly Impressionist style, comparable to that of Berthe Morisot and Mary Cassatt. Examples include The Lady in White (1880; Cambrai, Musée Municipal), On the Terrace at Sèvres (c. 1880; Geneva, Petit Palais) and Afternoon Tea (c. 1880; Paris, Petit Palais). After exhibiting at the Salon in 1874 and 1875, she took part in the Impressionist exhibitions of 1879, 1880 and 1886. In spite of the support of friends such as Gustave Geffroy, her husband was against any broadening of her career, and confined to Sèvres she produced only a limited amount of work. The retrospective exhibition of 1919 at the Galerie Bernheim-Jeune, Paris, included 90 paintings (to a large extent small sketches), 34 watercolours and 9 engravings. She also produced ceramics and several drawings for La Vie moderne (1879-80). With Morisot, Gonzalès and Cassatt, she was one of the greatest female representatives of Impressionism. "

He studied in Utrecht with Bloemaert and from about 1617 to 1625 was in Rome becoming one of the leading members of the first generation of Dutch painters of Italianate landscapes. His paintings are typically small scale (he often painted on copper) with biblical or mythological figures set in Arcadian landscapes, sometimes scattered with antique remnants. They are strongly influenced by Elsheimer, but cooler in colour than the German artist's work and without his sense of mystery. After returning to Utrecht Poelenburgh enjoyed a career of great success. He was Rubens's guide when he visited Utrecht in 1627, was popular in aristocratic and even royal circles (Charles I called him to England in 1637), and was imitated until the early 18th century. Sometimes he collaborated with Jan Both, in whose landscapes he painted the figures. "
40593,Bernardino Gatti,1485,1575,"Italian painter. In some documents he is said to have come from Pavia. His first documented work, the Resurrection (1529; Cremona Cathedral), shows that he had a thorough knowledge of Correggio's work and of the classicizing manner of Raphael and Giulio Romano. Correggio's influence became increasingly apparent, although it was blended with Lombard archaisms, as in the Virgin of the Rosary (1531; Pavia Cathedral) and in the Resurrection with the Virgin and St John the Baptist and the Last Supper (1534-35; both Vigevano Cathedral). In the frescoes of St George and the Dragon and scenes from the Life of the Virgin (1543; both Piacenza, Santa Maria di Campagna) he tried to refine his style further, still drawing on Giulio and Correggio but achieving only a somewhat bloodless sentimentality. This is evident in the Crucifixion (Piacenza, Municipio). By 1543 he was working in Piacenza, where he completed Pordenone's frescoes in the dome of a church. He moved to Cremona six years later, where his commissions included a large religious fresco  of 1552, notable for its vividly naturalistic portraits of contemporary noblemen in the guise of biblical characters. From 1560 to 1572, assisted by Bartholomaeus Spranger, Gatti worked in Parma on a prestigious commission to decorate the cupola of a major church. In the following year he returned to Cremona in order to paint a high altar for the city cathedral, but he died before finishing it. "

19456,Bernt Notke,1435,1509,"German sculptor, the leading wood-carver in the Baltic area during his period. He worked mainly in Lübeck, where he is first recorded (as a painter) in 1647, but his masterpiece was executed in Sweden, where he was summoned in 1483 to make a monument commemorating a victory by the Regent, Sten Sture, over the Danes. The victory was attributed to the assistance of St George, and Notke's stirring group of St George and the Dragon (completed 1489) in the Storkyrka (Stockholm's main church) is one of the greatest of all votive images. Its spiky forms represent the most expressionistic strain in late Gothic art and the vividly naturalistic details include the use of real elk antlers for the dragon's horns. "
40439,Jean Béraud,1849,1936,"French painter, born in St. Petersburg of French parents. His father (also called Jean) was a sculptor and was likely working on the site of St. Isaac's Cathedral at the time of his son's birth. Until the occupation of Paris during the Franco-Prussian war in 1870. he studied law in Paris. He then studied art at Léon Bonnat's studio for two years. He exhibited for the first time at the Salon in 1873. He was friendly with Manet and he loosely followed the Impressionist style from roughly 1875 to 1900. He looked up to both Edouard Manet and Edgar Degas. He focused on facets of daily life along the Parisian boulevards, imagery that found a wide audience at the time. His paintings did not rely simply on the fashionable bourgeois, but also depicted everyday mundane activities; children leaving school, a man leaving his apartment, men and women struggling against the wind - every contemporary theme was now available to him. To capture the essence of this activity, Béraud established his studio in a cab, therefore allowing him to watch unsuspecting passers-by, while also maintaining a regular stationary studio in Montmartre. In the 1890s he turned to religious themes in a more realistic style which led to controversial discussions at the Salon because of his practice of depicting biblical scenes in contemporary dress. He was awarded a gold medal at the 1889 Paris International Exhibition. His greatest achievement was his award of the prestigious Légion d'honneur in 1894. Béraud's focus towards the end of his career moved away from his own art and towards participation in the numerous exhibition committees he belonged to, including the Salon de la Société Nationale. "
42404,Etienne Jeaurat,1699,1789,"French painter and draughtsman. He was a favourite pupil of Nicolas Vleughels, who, when appointed director of the Académie Française in Rome in 1724, took Jeaurat with him, though it is hard to discern any Italian influence at all in Jeaurat's work. Jeaurat was approved (agréé) by the Académie Royale, Paris, in 1731 and was received (reçu) two years later as a history painter with his Pyramis and Thisbe (1733; Musée des Beaux-Arts et d'Archéologie Déchelette, Roanne). Jeaurat rose to the highest posts in the Académie, becoming professor in 1743, rector in 1765 and chancellor in 1781. He exhibited regularly at the Salon between 1737 and 1769, and the Gobelins factory made tapestries after his designs. Unlike his exact contemporary Chardin, whom tried to imitate, Jeaurat had a highly successful official career with his many posts. The older brother of Etienne Jeaurat, Edmond (Edme) Jeaurat (1688-1738), was engraver. The son the latter, Nicolas Henry Jeaurat, was also painter and studied under his uncle. "

He had an enormous reputation in the first two decades of the 17th century, when he gained some of the most prestigious commissions of the day, most notably the designing of the mosaics for the dome of St Peter's (1603-12). Although some of his early work is vigorous and colourful, his output is generally repetious and vacuous, untouched by the innovations of Caravaggio (who was briefly his assistant) or the Carracci. He was primarily a fresco painter, but he also did numerous cabinet pictures of religious or mythological scenes in a finicky Flemish manner. "

His altarpieces and history paintings, which unite late Baroque classicism with Venetian colour, brought new life to north Italian painting. The son of Lucia Boschetti and Francesco Balestra, a wealthy merchant, he studied literature, rhetoric and the humanities, but, after lessons in drawing and perspective with Giovanni Zeffis (d. 1688) and one Monsignor Bianchini (1646-1724), he moved to Venice in 1687 and trained with Antonio Bellucci. In 1691 he transferred to Rome, where he studied with Carlo Maratti, whose art continued a classical tradition that can be traced back to Raphael, and where he also absorbed the work of Annibale Carracci and Domenichino. In 1694 Balestra's large drawing of the Fall of the Giants (Rome, Galleria Accademia Nazionale di S Luca) won first prize in a competition at the Accademia di S Luca. In 1695 he returned to Verona, where he was acclaimed as the chief exponent in the Veneto of Maratti's late Baroque classicism. His pictures of this period were mainly small religious works, such as the Agony in the Garden (private collection). In Verona he established a school of painting. His masterpiece, the Recovery of the Bodies of Sts Cosma and Damian, is in the Basilica di Santa Giustina in Padova. "

He studied under François Diday in Geneva and then travelled to Paris (1837), to the Netherlands and Düsseldorf (1838), to Italy (1844) and to London (1850). Despite his frail health he spent each summer painting in the mountains of the Bernese Oberland and central Switzerland, where he produced the drawings and studies from nature that were later used in his studio compositions. A fervent Calvinist, he saw his subjects - the grandiose forces of nature, stormy summits and torrents as well as calm lakes - as expressions of Divine power. He enjoyed success during his lifetime, partly due to a firm adherence to a conventional landscape painting tradition. A year after Calame's arrival in Paris, the artist exhibited a Vue prise dans la Vallée d'Ansasca, effet du soir, in the Paris Salon of 1841. That painting was purchased by King Louis-Philippe and according to Calame's memoirs hung in, ""...le salon précédant la Salle du Trône aux Tuileries"". That painting, however, now hangs in the Assemblée National, Paris. Among his best-known pictures are Storm at Handeck (1839; Geneva, Museum of Art and History), Sunlight on the Upper Alps of the Valais, Opposite the Range of Mont-Rose (1843-44; Neuchâtel, Museum of Art and History), Ruins of the Temples of Paestum (1847; Leipzig, Museum der Bildenden Künste) and Lake of the Four Cantons (1855; Riggisberg, Abegg-Stiftung). Calame also left a large number of prints, notably lithographs, and a quantity of drawings (Geneva, Museum of Art and History and elsewhere). "

His biggest work, a cycle of frescos from the life of Charlemagne (Town Hall, Aachen), was once much admired as a great achievement of heroic history painting, but today seems hollow and theatrical. The cycle was begun in 1847 but left unfinished because of the madness that ended his career in 1853. Rethel is now mainly remembered for his series of woodcuts Another Dance of Death (1849), much in the spirit of Holbein's famous depictions of the subject, but satirizing the revolutionary events of 1848, with Death seen as the embodiment of anarchy. Two related woodcuts, Death as a Strangler (1847) and Death as a Friend (1851), were once extremely popular. "

Sika was a founding member of the Wiener Kunst im Hause (Viennese Art in the Home), a group established in 1901 whose members were drawn from the Kunstgewerbeschule. This group was regarded as a precursor to the Wiener Werkstätte, in part for its emphasis on creating unified interiors that embodied the ideal of the Gesamtkunstwerk or ""total work of art."" Sika was a skilled designer of ceramics and glass, working both for Josef Böck (ceramics) and E. Bakalowits & Söhne (glass). She designed women's fashion for various firms, providing accessories to Schwestern Flöge (Flöge Sisters), embroidery designs to Wiener Stickerei, and collaborated with the Salon Hilda Kulmer. Sika worked as a graphic designer as well, providing material for packaging, decorations and postcards. In the 1920s, Sika began to focus on painting, particularly floral subjects. "

40497,Lovis Corinth,1858,1925,"German painter and writer. He grew up on his family's farm and tannery. As a child he showed interest in art, taking informal lessons in drawing from a local carpenter and caricaturing his primary school teachers. Corinth's father sent him to secondary school in the nearby city of Königsberg (now Kaliningrad), where he lived with his widowed aunt. A superstitious woman fond of story-telling, she possessed what Corinth later described as a coarse temperament and an unrestrained, 'demonic' humour. These qualities and his aunt's bohemian acquaintances, including fortune-tellers and soothsayers, fascinated the young Corinth, accustomed to his more reserved parents. In this environment Corinth began to develop the rich imagination and love of anecdote that came to play such an important role in the evolution of his art. His artistic education began at the Königsberg art academy under Professor Otto Günther (1838-1884). Corinth accompanied Otto Günther on several journeys. In 1880 he went to Munich, where he continued his studies under Franz von Defregger (1835-1921) and later under Ludwig von Löfftz (1845-1910). His works of that period were influenced by the naturalist paintings of the Munich ""Leibl-Kreis"". After a short stay in Antwerp, Corinth moved to Paris. In Paris Corinth attended the well-known Académie Julian, where he was taught by Bouguereau and Robert-Fleury. In 1891 Corinth returned to Munich, where he became a founding member of the Munich ""Sezession"". Soon, however, the group started to crumble. Some artists split with the main group to form the ""Freie Vereinigung"". Due to a lack of work the artist went to Berlin in 1901, where he opened a painting school for women. One of his first female students was his future wife Charlotte Berend (1880-1967). Lovis Corinth became an official member of the Berlin Secession. When Liebermann was forced to step down as president, Corinth took over his position. In 1911 Corinth suffered a stroke and was temporarily paralysed on his left side. During Corinth's illness, Paul Cassirer became chairman of the Berlin Secession and in 1913 organized a retrospective, exhibiting 228 oil paintings. In 1917 the Akademie der Künste in Berlin awarded him the title of Professor. After a summer holiday at Urfeld on Lake Walchensee, Corinth acquired a property there in 1918 and began to build his own house in 1919. Until 1924 the artist repeatedly spent several months at ""Haus Petermann"" in Urfeld. In his art this is reflected by a series of Walchensee landscapes. Accompanied by a former student, Lovis Corinth travelled to Amsterdam in 1925 to see works by Rembrandt and Frans Hals. During this trip to Holland Corinth died of pneumonia. Corinth's oeuvre includes more than 100 paintings and several books and essays on painting. Today Corinth is regarded as one of the ""Classics of Modern Art"" and his works are exhibited in the most important museums and galleries of the German-speaking world. "

5961,Karl Daubigny,1846,1886,"Karl [Charles-Pierre] Daubigny, French painter and printmaker, son of Charles-François Daubigny. He studied with his father and, like him, specialized in landscape painting. He made his début at the Salon in 1863 and continued to exhibit there until the year of his death, winning medals in 1868 and 1874. His earliest works are obviously influenced by his father, but he soon came to develop a more personal and sombre style. The forest of Fontainebleau or the coastline and landscape of Brittany and Normandy provided most of his subjects (e.g. the Return of the Fishing Fleet to Trouville, 1872; Musée Granet, Aix-en-Provence, and the Banks of the Seine, 1880; Musée Municipal, Brest). He also produced a number of landscape etchings, including several after his father's paintings, two of which appeared in Frédéric Henriet's C. Daubigny et son oeuvre gravé (Paris, 1875). Despite his considerable ability, Karl's reputation has been rather eclipsed by that of his father, though he was nonetheless one of the most pleasing French landscape artists of the second half of the 19th century.

36211,Camille Pissarro,1830,1903,"French painter and printmaker. He was the only painter to exhibit in all eight of the Impressionist exhibitions held between 1874 and 1886, and he is often regarded as the 'father' of the movement. He was by no means narrow in outlook, however, and throughout his life remained as radical in artistic matters as he was in politics. The significance of Pissarro's work is in the balance maintained between tradition and the avant-garde. In Paris from 1855, he came under the influence of Corot and the Barbizon school. Later he allied himself with the Impressionists. After the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War of 1870-71, having only Danish nationality and being unable to join the army, he moved his family to Norwood, then a village on the edge of London. However, his style of painting, which was a forerunner of what was later called Impressionism, did not do well. In London, Pissarro met the Paris art dealer Paul Durand-Ruel who became the dealer helping sell his art for most of his life. Durand-Ruel put him in touch with Monet who was likewise in London during this period. They both viewed the work of British landscape artists Constable and Turner. After the war he returned to Paris and soon reestablished his friendships with the other Impressionist artists of his earlier group, including Cézanne, Monet, Manet, Renoir, and Degas. In 1884 he experimented with the theories of colour devised by Seurat. Abandoning divisionism in the 1890s, he reverted to a freer, more vital interpretation of nature. It was not until then that his works began to be popular. Pissarro's warmth and generosity made him an endearing figure to many French painters. He was especially beloved as teacher and friend to Gauguin, Cézanne, and Cassatt. His son Lucien was also his pupil. "

Her talent was encouraged by the writer Malvasia, who later wrote an adulatory biography of her in his 'Felsina Pittrice' (1678). She was active by 1655, and by 1662 she had recorded about ninety works, executing at least another eighty before she died at the age of 27. None of her portraits has survived but religious, mythological and allegorical subjects were painted in full view of a crowd of admirers. Her style is close to Reni's - idealized, affecting, sentimental, but with strong chiaroscuro and fine colour. Her sisters Anna Maria (1645-1515), and Barbara (alive in 1678) were also painters.

33855,Vincenzo Camuccini,1771,1844,"Italian painter, part of a family of dealers, collectors and painters. He was the brother of Pietro Camuccini (1760-1833), also a painter. From an early age Vincenzo was assisted and encouraged by Pietro, who had given up his place in the studio of Domenico Corvi (1721-1803) to Vincenzo. The younger brother's earliest known painting, the Sacrifice of Noah (1785; Cantalupo in Sabina, Palazzo Camuccini), is a competent work demonstrating his use of Corvi's technique of chiaroscuro. Between 1787 and 1789, on the advice of Pietro, Vincenzo undertook an intensive study of Michelangelo's and Raphael's frescoes at the Vatican. He also studied archaeology with Ennio Quirino Visconti, who introduced him to leading ecclesiastics within the papal court of Pope Pius VI. It was probably through his brother that Vincenzo met Frederick Augustus Hervey, Bishop of Derry (later 4th Earl of Bristol), who commissioned from him a copy (1789) of Raphael's Entombment (both Rome, Galleria Borghese). His familiarity with the art of the High Renaissance and with 17th-century Roman art is eloquently displayed in his drawings from c. 1787. In Joseph Interpreting the Dreams (c. 1795; Florence, Uffizi), for example, he is clearly influenced by the monumental quality of Michelangelo's figures. He produced drawings of antique sculpture after plaster casts and such originals as Trajan's Column, the heroic reliefs of which helped shape his interpretation of Roman history. His many drawings reveal a fluid technique and lively artistic imagination. Camuccini's first major independent work, completed around 1798, was a large canvas of the Death of Caesar. In 1800, he was commissioned an Incredulity of St. Thomas (copy of mosaic) by the Vatican. In 1806, Gaspare Landi received a commission for two large canvases for the chapel of the Madonna of the Rosary in the church of San Giovanni in Piacenza. Ultimately, the commission was split with Camuccini who painted a Presentation in the Temple. Camuccini was also a successful portrait painter, he executed portrait of many important personages including Pope Pius VII, and the King and Queen of Naples. Several of his works were engraved by Pietro Bettelini (1763-1829). Camuccini was appointed inspector-general of the Museums of the Pope, and of the Factory of Mosaics, and director of the Neapolitan Academy of Rome. He was a member of the Institute of France, during some years president of the Academy of St. Luke. Pope Pius VII conferred upon him the title of Baron, with hereditary succession, and the Emperor Francis I the order of the Iron Crown. "

22069,David Roentgen,1743,1807,"German cabinetmaker to Queen Marie-Antoinette of France; under his direction the family workshop at Neuwied (near Cologne), founded by his father, Abraham Roentgen, became perhaps the most-successful firm of furniture production in the 18th century. After succeeding his father as head of the Neuwied workshop in 1772, Roentgen strove to broaden their clientele, an ambition that brought him first to Hamburg and ultimately to Paris (1774), where in 1779 he was spectacularly successful in selling his finest furniture to King Louis XVI of France for £3,300 to £4,000, an unprecedented sum for the time. Appointed cabinetmaker to the queen, Roentgen was granted admission (1780) as maître-ébéniste (master cabinetmaker) to the trade corporation of Paris cabinetmakers, making it possible for him to keep in Paris a stock of the furniture manufactured at Neuwied. Thus he was able to compete with such great cabinetmakers as Jean-Henri Riesener and Adam Weisweiler, reputedly his former pupil at Neuwied. After his first visit to St. Petersburg, Empress Catherine II the Great bought huge quantities of his furniture; King Frederick William II of Prussia was also his client. When in 1795 the French Revolutionary armies threatened to cross the Rhine, Roentgen evacuated his establishment and moved his stock farther inland. Unfortunately, he lost everything in his Parisian salon and in his Neuwied workshop, both of which were sacked by Republican troops. He was crushed, despite his appointment as court furnisher to the king of Prussia. Although he never succeeded in starting production again, former apprentices of his whom he helped to establish in the German cities of Berlin (David Hacker) and Brunswick (Christian Härder) were successful. Roentgen had begun his career by continuing and developing the Rococo furniture that his father had introduced. The furniture of his ""French"" style is characterized by curved outline, sometimes decorated with rich carvings. His ""English"" cabinetwork is based on elements dating from the early years of King George III and occasionally influenced by the renowned furniture manufacturer Thomas Chippendale. Both national types are frequently decorated with rich inlay of outstanding charm and elegance composed of a variety of woods, some tinted and made to form figural and floral compositions, often in the manner of chinoiserie (Chinese motifs). Between 1775 and 1780 Roentgen abandoned his earlier styles in favour of rigid, classical forms, the effect of which is often based on contrasting mahogany with rich bronze appliqués, represented in his monumental combined secretaire and medal-cabinet of about 1785-89. His workshop indulged in mechanical devices, a characteristic flair begun by his father, that made drawers and mirrors appear and disappear by pressing on hidden releases; Peter Kinzing invented many of these gadgets and provided the workshop with clockworks.

A pupil of his father, Leo Lehmann, and Ingres, whose studio he entered in 1831, Lehmann enjoyed a long and much honoured career. His work reflects his fervent admiration and emulation of Ingres, his respect for the art of the Nazarenes and his study of 17th-century Italian art. Beginning in 1835, Lehmann exhibited regularly at the Salon, winning first-class medals in 1840, 1848, and 1855. Renowned for his graceful portraits, he depicted many of his era's leaders, such as writers and composers. He also received numerous commissions for large-scale compositions, including decorations for the city hall of Paris in 1852, which were destroyed in 1871. Lehmann became head of the Académie des Beaux-Arts in 1861. He was a master there from 1875, with Camille Pissarro and Georges Seurat among his students - both of whom found his conservative regimen unappealing. Lehmann often collaborated with Ingres and visited him twice in Italy. "

40643,Jacob Jordaens,1593,1678,"Flemish painter, the pupil and son-in-law of Adam van Noort. Although Jordaens often assisted Rubens, he had a flourishing studio of his own by the 1620s, and after Rubens's death in 1640 he was the leading figure painter in Flanders. His style was heavily indebted to Rubens, but was much more earthbound, using thick impasto, strong contrasts of light and shade, and colouring that is often rather lurid. His physical types, too, are coarser than Rubens's and his name is particularly associated with large canvases of hearty rollicking peasants. Two of his favourite subjects, which he depicted several times are The Satyr and the Peasant, based on one of Aesop's fables, and The King Drinks, which depicts a boisterous group enjoying an abundant Twelfth Night feast. Jordaens's prolific output, however, included many other subjects, including religious works and portraits, and he also etched and made designs for tapestries. He rarely left his native Antwerp, but commissions came from all over Europe, the most important being The Triumph of Frederick Hendrik (1651-2), an enormous composition painted for the Huis ten Bosch, the royal villa near The Hague. In about 1655 Jordaens became a Calvinist; he continued to paint pictures for Catholic churches, but the work of the last two decades of his life is more subdued. "
33044,Otto Wagner,1841,1918,"Austrian architect, urban planner, designer, teacher and writer. He was one of the most important architects of the 19th and 20th centuries - in 1911, Adolf Loos called him 'the greatest architect in the world' - and a key figure in the development of 20th-century European architecture. His work, spread over more than half a century, embodies the transition from mid-19th-century historicism to the earliest expressions of 20th-century Modernism. Wagner was an influential teacher and theorist, and in addition to his executed work, he designed and published more than 100 ambitious schemes, the last volume of his Einige Skizzen being published posthumously in 1922; this long series of often fantastic but always highly pragmatic and carefully thought out projects included urban plans, museums, academies, parliament buildings and public monuments. Wagner studied architecture at the School of Architecture at the Vienna Academy (1861-63), where he later became a teacher 1904-12). Among his students were the renowned Art Nouveau architects Josef Maria Olbrich and Josef Hoffmann. His first buildings were villas in the style of the Florentine Renaissance. From 1893, he turned away from historicism and called for a new style suited to the needs of the modern-day. In other words, he called for a language of form based on considerations of function, material and construction - one of the principles of modern architecture of the 1920s. He expanded his ideas in his book Moderne Architektur of 1896. His most important buildings in this new style are those for the Vienna Stadtbahn metropolitan railway (1894-1901) and the Austrian Post Office Savings Bank (1904-06). He designed and built a career-long series of 13 large residential blocks in Vienna. Typical examples are those at Schottenring 23 (1877) and Stadiongasse 6-8 (1882), and later the blocks at Linke Wienzeile 38-40, including the Majolika Haus (1898). The Kirche am Steinhof (the sanatorium church of St Leopold, 1903-07) was one of his important late projects. Wagner was of major significance for the development of architecture around 1900 and a pioneer of modern architecture. His pupils, who included Josef Maria Olbrich and Josef Hoffmann, developed his ideas even further. Alongside his activities as an architect, Wagner also produced designs for applied art, particularly during his membership of the Vienna Secession (1899-1905), which he left with the Klimt group. "

34083,John Crome,1768,1821,"English painter, printmaker and collector, active in the city of Norwich. The son of a journeyman weaver, he was apprenticed to a coach and sign painter, Francis Whisler, from 1783 to 1790. He presumably continued in this trade and during the 1790s consolidated his artistic training. Early local influences upon Crome included William Beechey and John Opie, but the friendship of Thomas Harvey, a patron, collector and amateur artist, was the most significant. Harvey's collection included works by Dutch 17th-century masters such as Aelbert Cuyp, Jacob van Ruisdael and Meindert Hobbema, and also works by Gainsborough and Richard Wilson. The Dutch influence was strong throughout Crome's career. The local press credited Crome early for his role as a founder of the Norwich Society of Artists in 1803 and the Norwich school of painters. Crome's monochromatic paintings, such as his magnificent View of Carrow Abbey, near Norwich (1805; Norwich, Castle Museum), did not find universal acceptance. Although he later lightened his palette his work was criticized for its 'unfinished' appearance even towards the end of his career. Crome was a major artist of the Norwich school and a representative of the transition from the 18th century Picturesque tradition to the Romantic approach to landscape. His work is noted for its bold use of space, attentiveness to local detail and broad handling of paint. His subject-matter was invariably the local landscape, including buildings and intimate scenes on the rivers Yare and Wensum, such as Back of the New Mills, Norwich (c. 1814-17) and New Mills: Men Wading (c. 1812; both Norwich, Castle Museum). Crome's sons, the most talented of whom was John Berney Crome (1794-1842), painted in his father's manner and continued his teaching practice, although they did not achieve the same success as their father. The Norwich School of painters, founded by John Crome and Robert Ladbrooke in 1803 in Norwich, was the first provincial art movement in Britain. Artists of the school were inspired by the natural beauty of the Norfolk landscape and owed some influence to the work of landscape painters of the Dutch Golden Age such as Hobbema and Ruisdael. The leading figure of the school was John Crome until his death in 1821. The society was kept together by John Sell Cotman until 1834 when Cotman left Norwich for London. The society effectively ceased to exist from that date. Norwich School artists included amateurs as well as professionals, many of whom practiced the avant-garde method of plein air painting. The Norwich School remains an important historical element in the larger tradition of English landscape painting. "

Rysbrack studied at Antwerp, probably in the workshop of Michael van de Voort. In 1720 he established himself in London, together with his brother Pieter Andreas, where he lived until his death. Rysbrack worked in a classical, sometimes eclectic manner, avoiding emphatic gestures, exaggerated asymmetry, and extremes of illusionism. His work includes 16 monuments in Westminster Abbey, London; the splendid equestrian statue of William III in Bristol, Gloucestershire; tombs in parish churches all over England; and innumerable portrait busts. In some respects Rysbrack outshone Louis-François Roubiliac, his only rival for preeminence in England at that time. Pyramidal composition and judicious choice of material are characteristics of his funeral sculpture. "

Dauzats was one of the first painters to embark on exploratory trips to exotic countries. In 1830, he traveled with Baron Taylor to Egypt, the Sinai, Palestine, and Syria. He went to Spain several times (1835 to 1837), then to Algeria (1839) and Tangiers (1850). Although his orientalist work was free of the constraints inherent in a commission, it essentially consisted of views of monuments with landscapes of varying size, depending on the work. He was a frequent exhibitor at the Salon of genre subjects and interiors of churches, and was also a lithographer. He was a friend of Delacroix who asked him to be one of his executors. "

He worked mainly in Rome and although he was only 37 when he died he had made a great name for himself as a fresco decorator, working most notably for the Farnese family in their palace at Caprarola. His style was based on Michelangelo and Raphael and tended to be rather dry and wooden. "

36513,Jan Saenredam,1565,1607,"Netherlandish engraver, draughtsman and mapmaker, part of a family of artists. Orphaned in childhood, he was raised by an uncle, Pieter de Jongh, a bailiff in Assendelft. Though brought up for a life of farm labour and handiwork, he turned to drawing and in time attained some success as a mapmaker. With the help of a local lawyer, he entered the circle of Hendrick Goltzius relatively late in life, in 1589, and worked for short periods with both Goltzius and Jacques de Gheyn II. According to both de Bie and Schrevelius, there was some rivalry between each of these masters and Saenredam, who quickly absorbed what they had to offer him. About 1595 Saenredam returned to Assendelft, where he married and where his son Pieter was born. "

33711,Francesco Botticini,1446,1497,"Francesco Botticini (Francesco di Giovanni di Domenico), Florentine painter. The son of a painter of playing cards, Botticini was apprenticed in 1459 to the successful Florentine painter Bicci di Neri. From 1471 he was a meber of the Confraternity of the Archangel Raphael at Santo Spirito, and in 1472 he was inscribed in the Confraternity of St Luke. His style consists almost entirely of elements drawn from his more illustrious contemporaries - Sandro Botticelli, Domenico Ghirlandaio, Filippino Lippi, Andrea del Verrocchio. He painted one remarkable work, however, the Assumption of the Virgin (National Gallery, London, c. 1474), which has the distinction of being the only picture from the Quattrocento known to have been painted to illustrate a heresy. The donor, Matteo Palmieri, believed that human souls are the angels who stayed neutral when Satan rebelled against God. "

27302,Pietro della Vecchia,1605,1678,"Italian painter. Until 1984 he was mentioned as Pietro Muttoni, called della Vecchia. However, this description was founded on a misunderstanding created by Lanzi, who in his Storia pittorica della Italia confused the name of the artist with the name of a collection, Muttoni, in which he had seen one of his paintings. In fact, Pietro was from the well-known Venetian family, the della Vecchia. His earliest known works, two representations of St Francis, which have survived in many versions (e.g. Modena, Galleria Estense; Rovigo, Accademia Concordi), and a Crucifixion (1633; Venice, S Lio) are so heavily influenced by Carlo Saraceni and his student and collaborator Jean Leclerc as to suggest that della Vecchia trained with them. Certain Caravaggesque elements, which remained in his work for some time to come, suggest that he spent some time in Rome after Leclerc had left Venice, in 1621 or 1622. The influence of Alessandro Varotari or Padovanino, who is described by sources as della Vecchia's teacher, is only noticeable in dated works from 1635 onwards. Della Vecchia probably worked in Padovanino's studio c. 1625-26, after his trip to Rome, and from the latter he derived his great interest in 16th-century painting in Venice and the Veneto. His monumental Crucifixion (1637; Venice, Fondazione Cini), in which the composition harks back to the 16th century while the figures derive from Caravaggio, is characteristic of this phase. Around 1640 the influence of Bernardo Strozzi is apparent in his work, as in the Angel Offering a Skull to St Giustina, Who Stands between St Joseph and St John (1640; Venice, Accademia), painted for the church of S Giustina. Also in 1640 he began to design cartoons for the mosaics in S Marco, on which he worked until 1673. "

22946,Jacopo Sansovino,1486,1570,"Italian architect and sculptor, who was instrumental in introducing the High Renaissance style to Venice. Originally named Jacopo Tatti, he was trained in Florence by the sculptor Andrea Sansovino, whose name he adopted; his early sculpture was influenced principally by ancient classical works. Jacopo's studies in Florence were interrupted in 1505, when Andrea was called to Rome to execute the tombs of Cardinal Ascanio Sforza and Cardinal Girolamo Basso della Rovere in the choir of Santa Maria del Popolo. Jacopo followed soon after in the train of Giuliano da Sangallo, whose protégé he became. In Rome he studied and copied Classical sculptures and may have collaborated with Andrea at Santa Maria del Popolo. Vasari related that Jacopo attracted the attention of Donato Bramante in Rome, and that in 1507 or 1508 he won a competition, organized by  Bramante and judged by  Raphael, for the best copy of the recently unearthed antique sculpture of the Laocoön (Museo Pio-Clementino, Vatican). One surviving work from this first Roman period, the ambitious Descent from the Cross (Victoria and Albert Museum, London), was conceived as a studio model for the painter Perugino and modelled in wax with great bravura. Sansovino returned to Florence c. 1510 and almost immediately assumed a position of prominence. Possibly through Baccio d'Agnolo, he gained the two commissions for marble statuary that confirmed his reputation as a serious rival to Michelangelo, the Bacchus (Bargello, Florence) and St James the Greater for the Cathedral. The St James occupied Sansovino between 1511 and 1518, and in that period he shared a studio with Andrea del Sarto. Their workshop was frequented by a number of artists and sometime pupils, including Niccolò Tribolo and Jacopo Pontormo. In addition Sansovino was in contact with such older artists as Andrea della Robbia and Giovanni Francesco Rustici as well as such patrons as the patricians Giovanni de' Gaddi and Bindo Altoviti. In 1518 the limited opportunities available in Florence led Sansovino back to Rome, which he may have visited briefly in May 1516 to sign the contract for his most famous work of the period, the marble Martelli Virgin and Child, or Madonna del Parto (Sant'Agostino, Rome). In Rome, Sansovino was taken up by the Florentine community, winning the competition (c. 1519) to design their church, San Giovanni dei Fiorentini, against Raphael, Baldassare Peruzzi and Antonio da Sangallo the Younger. The project foundered through technical and financial difficulties, and in January 1521 Sansovino was effectively replaced by Sangallo. One of his three major buildings from this period survives, the Palazzo Gaddi, planned c. 1518 for his Florentine patron Giovanni de' Gaddi and his brothers on the Via del Banco, Rome. During these years Sansovino executed only two major pieces of sculpture, both private commissions obtained through the Florentine community and his connections with the papal curia. The marble Madonna del Parto (Sant'Agostino, Rome), made for Giovan Francesco Martelli, is one of Sansovino's most popular sculptures. The St James of Compostella (Santa Maria di Monserrato, Rome), also of marble, amounts to a paraphrase of a motif from Michelangelo's projects for San Lorenzo, Florence. Sansovino's career probably would have remained within the Florentine–Roman axis had it not been for the Sack of Rome in 1527, which sent him and many other artists away from central Italy. He went to Venice, where in 1529 he became proto (chief architect) to the Procurators of San Marco, and he held this office over the next four decades. As proto, he enjoyed a monopoly of the main architectural and sculptural commissions for most of his Venetian career, much like Gian Lorenzo Bernini in Rome the following century. Together with his close friends Titian and Pietro Aretino, Sansovino dominated the artistic life of Venice in the mid-16th century. As chief architect, Sansovino designed palaces, churches, and public buildings, uniting the classical tradition of the Florentine master Bramante with the more highly ornamented Venetian style. Sansovino's major architectural contribution to Venice was in transforming the appearance of the Piazza San Marco through the planning of three buildings, the Zecca (public mint), the Library and the Loggetta. All three were conceived between 1535 and 1537 and were ordered by small, interlocking civic committees. Sansovino also designed two major palaces on the Grand Canal, the Palazzo Dolfin (begun 1538) and the Palazzo Corner at San Maurizio (begun 1545). The Palazzo Corner (designed 1532) represents the first successful use of the classical façade - columns, arcades, and arched windows - in Venice; it became the standard for Venetian palaces for the next century. Sansovino was a strong influence on the later Venetian architects Andrea Palladio and Baldassare Longhena. "

2363,Giuseppe Bezzuoli,1784,1855,"Giuseppe Bezzuoli (or Bazzuoli), Italian painter and teacher. A leading exponent of academic Romanticism in Italy, he initially received drawing lessons from his friend Luigi Sabatelli. From 1786 he attended the Accademia delle Belle Arti in Florence, where he studied under Giuseppe Piattoli (c. 1743-1823), Jean-Baptiste Desmarais (1756-1813) and Pietro Benvenuti. In 1811 he was made the Accademia's Aiuto Maestro di Disegno e Figura, and in 1812 he won the Concorso Triennale. In 1815-16 he made the first of several visits to Bologna, where he admired and studied its 17th-century painters. This marked the beginning of his romantic turn. Paolo and Francesca (1816; private collection), commissioned by the Conte Sante Alari of Milan, was the first Florentine work depicting a literary Romantic subject. Probably inspired by Sabatelli, it reflected a new Romantic ferment in the arts after the departure of the Bonapartes; two plays and a novel on the same theme were published around 1814-16. In 1816 Bezzuoli was made professor and became Sottomaestro di Disegno. He travelled to Rome and Naples in 1818-19 and to Venice in 1823. In Rome he encountered foreign artists, copied Raphael's School of Athens (Rome, Vatican, Stanza della Segnatura) for Conte Paolo Tosi from Brescia, and drew from Michelangelo, the Bolognese masters, and from nature in the Roman Campagna. One of his principal works is the Entry of Charles VIII into Florence (Palazzo Pitti, Florence). He decorated a small Tribune of Galileo at the Natural History Museum at Florence, and the more important series of scenes from the life of Caesar (1836) in one of the rooms on the ground floor of the Pitti Palace. Among his pupils were Giovanni Fattori, Enrico Pollastrini, and Silvestro Lega. "

34312,Ambroise Dubois,1543,1614,"Flemish painter, active in France. He was one of the painters of the Second Fontainebleau school. By 1595 (and possibly earlier) he was established at Fontainebleau, where he contributed to the decoration of the Galerie d'Ulysse (destroyed) and the Galerie de Diane (constructed 1600, destroyed 1810); fragments of the latter have been incorporated into the Galerie des Assiettes. In 1606 he embarked on the decoration of the Queen's apartment (destroyed) for Marie de' Medici. The first book that the Queen was said to have read in French was a version of the story of Tancredi and Clorinda from Torquato Tasso's Gerusalemme liberate, and the apartment was decorated with episodes from this romance; the heroic portrayal of the warrior woman Clorinda must have been congenial to the Queen. The surviving pictures are now divided between Fontainebleau and the Musée du Louvre. Dubois also decorated the Oval Chamber (now the Salon Louis XIII) with scenes from the story of Theagenes and Chariclea from the Aethiopica of Heliodorus. "

41357,Hendrik Voogd,1766,1839,"Dutch painter and printmaker, active in Italy. He studied from 1783 at the Stadstekenakademie in Amsterdam and subsequently with the wallpaper painter Jurriaan Andriessen. The financial aid of the Amsterdam art collector D. Versteegh (1751-1822) enabled him to depart in 1788 for Rome to obtain further training in landscape painting. Voogd's works from his first Roman years are primarily drawings with coloured wash in the typical late 18th-century linear style; an expressive example is River Landscape near Narni (1789; Haarlem, Teylers Museum). Owing to the absence of Dutch colleagues in Rome, Voogd spent much of his time with the Franco-Flemish and German artists' colonies there. Internationally famous landscape painters, such as Nicolas-Didier Boguet, Johann Christian Reinhart and Johann Martin von Rohden, were among his close friends, and the work of the last, in particular, is often mistaken for that of Voogd. It is apparent, from one of the infrequent letters that Voogd sent to Versteegh in the Netherlands, that he made numerous drawings of Rome and its environs (Tivoli, Lake Albano, Castel Gandolfo, Lake Nemi etc). Some of these drawings, executed mostly in pencil and black chalk, consist of motifs taken directly from nature, such as trees and rocks; others portray views. Both categories are represented in Amsterdam (Historisch Museum and Rijksmuseum). Voogd claimed that his great exemplar, in addition to nature, was Claude Lorrain; from shortly after 1800 he was named the 'Dutch Claude Lorrain'. Although this nickname is somewhat exaggerated, it does indicate that Voogd's style had developed between 1795 and 1805 from an austere draughtsman-like manner into something far more picturesque. Examples illustrating this development include his Italian Landscape with Umbrella Pines of 1795 (Amsterdam, Rijksmuseum) and two Italian landscapes (private collection) from 1802 and 1803. However, Voogd never completely abandoned his Netherlandish heritage: he was fascinated by unusual lighting effects and luxuriant foliage (e.g. 1804; Leipzig, Museum der Bildenden Künste) and from 1806 onwards was fond of drawing animals, particularly cattle (1806; Hamburg, Kunsthalle). Italian cattle began to feature prominently in his drawings and paintings (1817; Bassano del Grappa, Museo Civico; and 1829; Heino, Hannema-de Stuers Fundatie). "

Stella is an example of a painter who enjoyed great esteem in his lifetime, both as an artist and a patron (of Nicolas Poussin), but whose work is no longer appreciated. Most of the early part of his career was spent in Italy, both in Florence and Rome, and he must have been strongly influenced by the small Madonnas of Raphael. He became a friend of Poussin in Rome and acquired numerous pictures by him, including the Venus and Aeneas now at Rouen. Poussin influenced Stella's sweetly decorative style (which is similar in scale and charm to that of Lubin Baugin) to the point where his pictures became cold and hard and lacking in sentimentality. Unusually for a Frenchman, Stella sometimes painted on a precious ground such as lapis-lazuli or marble, allowing the pattern of the stone to form part of the composition. "

The brothers' mother was a court opera singer in Dessau, and Ferdinand's later interest in the German medieval and Nazarene styles owed much to the intellectual climate at the Anhalt-Dessau court, where Leopold III Frederick Francis, Prince of Anhalt-Dessau, had been the first German prince to introduce the Gothic Revival style. Olivier took up drawing in 1801-02 under the tuition of Carl Wilhelm Kolbe and the engraver Johann Christian Haldenwang. In 1802-03 he accompanied his father to Berlin, where he studied woodcut techniques under Johann Friedrich Gottlieb Unger and may have attended August Wilhelm Schlegel's lectures on belles-lettres and art. It was here, at the latest, that he discovered Herzensergiessungen eines kunstliebenden Klosterbruders (Berlin, 1797) by Wilhelm Heinrich Wackenroder and Ludwig Tieck, and the latter's Franz Sternbalds Wanderungen (Berlin, 1798), two books of vital significance for the painting of the Romantic era. Having decided to make art their career, Ferdinand and his brother Heinrich spent two years (1804-06) in Dresden, where they copied the works of Ruisdael and Claude Lorrain in the art gallery during the summer months. Ferdinand also took lessons from Jacob Wilhelm Mechau and Carl Ludwig Kaaz, both painters of idealized landscapes, and he was probably introduced to the work of Philipp Otto Runge and Caspar David Friedrich by Friedrich August von Klinkowström, a friend of Runge. In June 1807 Ferdinand's excellent knowledge of French led to his appointment as embassy secretary in Paris, where Heinrich soon joined him. However, after just a few weeks he gave up his diplomatic career in order to devote himself to a study of the Musée Napoléon, which at that time housed art treasures pillaged from all parts of Europe. Ferdinand and Heinrich jointly produced three paintings for Leopold III Frederick Francis of Anhalt-Dessau: a portrait of Napoleon on Horseback (c. 1809; Wörlitz, Schloss), and a Last Supper and Baptism (1809-10; Wörlitz, Evangelical Church) for the Gothic Revival church in Wörlitz. Although these last two were supposed to be copies after the 'old German school', the Olivier brothers in fact used 15th- and 16th-century Dutch and Flemish models to create original compositions. At the end of 1809 they returned to Dessau. In 1810, on a tour of the Harz with his younger brother Friedrich Olivier, Ferdinand produced a number of markedly naturalistic sketches that testify to the break with his schooling in Dresden, for example Cliffs on the Brocken (1810; Dessau, Anhaltische Gemäldegalerie). In 1811 he travelled with Friedrich via Dresden to Vienna where the Lukasbrüder had been formed shortly before. Although the group had since moved to Rome, the Olivier brothers soon became acquainted with its ideals through Philipp Veit, Friedrich von Schlegel's stepson, whose home they frequented, and Joseph Sutter. In 1817, with Julius Schnorr von Carolsfeld, they were accepted - from afar - into the Lukasbrüder. Starting 1830 Olivier lived in Munich where he became secretary-general of the Akademie der Künste (Art Academy), which was followed by a post as professor for art history. Olivier, who personally never visited Rome, is nevertheless one of the most important Nazarenes, having devoted himself to spiritually inspired works executed in the style of the German Renaissance masters. After relocating to Munich he painted in the idealized landscape manner of Dughet and Poussin. "

34611,Paul Gauguin,1848,1903,"Eugene-Henri-Paul Gauguin, French painter, sculptor, and printmaker. He was the son of Clovis Gauguin, a liberal journalist from Orléans and Aline Chazal, a French-Peruvian (Creole) mother. He spent his childhood in Lima, Peru, between 1851 and 1855. In 1865 he entered the Navy and became an assistant pilot in the Merchant Marine. He traveled the Atlantic Ocean between Le Havre and Rio de Janeiro. An officer on board gave him a glowing account of the two years he had spent in Polynesia. In 1871 he resigned from the Navy and found a job on the Paris Stock Exchange with the firm Bertin as stockbroker. He made a considerable fortune and led the life of a well-to-do bourgeois. He met Émile Schuffenecker and took up painting with him in his spare time. In 1873 Gauguin married Mette-Sophi Gaad, from Denmark. The couple had five children, Émile (born 1874), Aline (Gauguin's favourite daughter, born 1877), Clovis (born 1879), Jean-René (born 1881), Pola (born 1883). In 1874 Gauguin enrolled as a student in the Académie Colarossi (an art school founded by the Italian sculptor Filippo Colarossi in Paris). Soon he started to collect paintings. By 1880 he had his own studio, and his art collection included works by all the Impressionists. He showed one sculpture and seven oil paintings at the Impressionist exhibition in that year, his Study of a Nude (Suzanne Sewing) was favourable reviewed. In spite of Monet's and Renoir's protest, Gauguin showed eight paintings and two sculptures at the Impressionist exhibition in 1881, and one sculpture and twelve paintings in 1882. These works were harshly criticised. In 1883 Gauguin and Schuffenecker lost their job at Bertin. Gauguin regarded it as an opportunity to dedicate himself to art. He worked with Pissarro at Osny, and in 1884 at Rouen. Due to the growing financial difficulties, he sent his family to Copenhagen in July, and join then in November to stay near her family. He left for Copenhagen in 1885, where he unsuccessfully pursued a business career. He returned penniless to Paris and led a life of extreme poverty, working at odd jobs. In 1886 Gauguin took part in the 8th Impressionist exhibition with one sculpture and eighteen paintings revealing Pissarro's influence. he spent the summer at Pont-Aven, Brittany, where he met Émile Bernard. Gauguin coined the term Synthetism to describe his style during this period, referring to the synthesis of his paintings' formal elements with the idea or emotion they conveyed. He returned to Paris, where he met Vincent van Gogh. Increasingly, Gauguin turned to primitive cultures for inspiration. In April 1887 Gauguin sailed to Panama and later Martinique with the painter Charles Laval. He returned to France in December and stayed with Schuffenecker. In 1888 Gauguin came into his own style during his second stay at Pont-Aven with Émile Bernard. He met there Paul Sérusier. Theo van Gogh organized his first one-man show exhibiting his ceramics and paintings from Martinique and Brittany. He left for Arles in October, where he stayed for two months with Vincent van Gogh. The style of the two men's work from this period has been classified as Post-Impressionist because it shows an individual, personal development of Impressionism's use of colour, brushstroke, and nontraditional subject matter. He returned to Paris when van Gogh went mad and stayed with Schuffenecker. In 1889 he paintings of Martinique, Brittany and Arles at the exhibition of the Peintres Impressionists et Synthétists in Paris, then he took part in the Salon des XX in Brussels. He returned to Pont-Aven in April and in October he settled at Le Pouldu. In 1891 he sold thirty paintings to raise money for his trip to Tahiti. Increasingly focused on rejecting the materialism of contemporary culture in favour of a more spiritual, unfettered lifestyle, in June 1891 he settled in Tahiti from where he returned to Paris in August 1893. He painted some of his finest paintings there. Durand-Ruel organized a one-man show at which he showed his Tahiti paintings. The show made a profound impression on the Nabis painters. In 1894 he stayed again in Pont-Aven and Le Pouldu with Annah the Javanese. He executed woodcuts and experimented with watercolour transfer monotypes. He returned to Paris where Annah disappeared after having stolen all the valuables from Gauguin's studio. In 1895 he returned to Tahiti and built a large house in the native style. He lived in a great solitude and physical suffering. He worked on Noa Noa, an autobiographical novel set in Tahiti, which was published in 1897. His works were shown at the fourth Salon de la Libre Esthétique in Brussels. In 1898 he attempted suicide which was followed by a period of great productivity. In 1900 he was seriously ill, with no money for medical treatment. His works were included in the Centennial Exhibition of French Art 1800-1889 at the World Fair. In August 1901 he moved to Atuona, on the island of Hiva Oa, Marquesas Islands, French Polynesia. In 1903 he was sentenced to three months imprisonment for protesting the authorities' treatment of the natives. He died on May 8 1903. A Gauguin retrospective was organised at the Salon d'Automne with 227 works in 1906. Assessment Gauguin's style developed from Impressionism through a brief cloisonnist phase (in partnership with Émile Bernard) towards a highly personal brand of Symbolism, which sought within the tradition of Pierre Puvis de Chavannes to combine and contrast an idealized vision of primitive Polynesian culture with the sceptical pessimism of an educated European. A selfconsciously outspoken personality and an aggressively asserted position as the leader of the Pont-Aven group made him a dominant figure in Parisian intellectual circles in the late 1880s. His use of non-naturalistic colour and formal distortion for expressive ends was widely influential on early 20th-century avant-garde artists. "

42097,Johann Michael Rottmayr,1654,1730,"Austrian painter and draughtsman. He is most notable for large-scale religious and secular decorative schemes, and his career heralded the important 18th-century German contribution to late Baroque and Rococo fresco painting. He was probably taught by his mother, who was a painter of wooden sculpture. Between 1675 and 1687-88 he was in Venice as a pupil and assistant of the Munich artist Johann Carl Loth, whose studio attracted many painters from Austria and southern Germany. It is possible that Rottmayr also visited other Italian cities, in particular Bologna and Rome. He returned to Salzburg in the late 1680s a mature painter and immediately received commissions for panels and frescoes. In 1689 he painted mythological scenes for the Karabinierisaal at the Residenz in Salzburg (in situ); in composition and style these are close to high Baroque models, particularly the work of Pietro da Cortona and Peter Paul Rubens. Such models, as well as the example of Loth, and Venetian painting, had an important influence on Rottmayr's panel paintings of this period, for example the Sacrifice of Iphigenia (c. 1691; Vienna, Belvedere) or St Agnes (1693-95) and St Sebastian (1694; both Passau, Cathedral). In these, the solidity of the figures is emphasized through the use of intense colours. For Rottmayr, however, the rational development of the figures and the composition was less important than the overall effect achieved by the use of colour. Incorrect details of anatomy and perspective found compensation in greater expressiveness, mainly conveyed by gesture and pose. Rottmayr's images are filled with plastic elements, creating a staccato effect. Several very important early commissions paved the way for Rottmayr's move to Vienna in the late 1690s. In the allegorical frescoes (1695) at Schloss Frain an der Thaya (now Vranov nad Dyjí, Czech Republic) Rottmayr's talent for accommodating architecture within decoration is evident. Rottmayr acknowledged the basic architectural design in the division of his scenes, with the central scene (an illusionistic view into the heavens) coinciding with the central cupola, a system based on Pietro da Cortona's frescoes at the Palazzo Barberini in Rome. In spite of the weight and solidity of the figures, the use of lighter, harmonious colour achieves a transition to immateriality. This corresponds with the allegorical allusions to the virtues of the Althan family, from whom Rottmayr received this commission. "

40784,Salvator Rosa,1615,1673,"Italian Baroque painter and etcher of the Neapolitan school remembered for his wildly romantic or ""sublime"" landscapes, marine paintings, and battle pictures. He was also an accomplished poet, satirist, actor, and musician. Rosa studied painting in Naples, coming under the influence of the Spanish painter and engraver José de Ribera. Rosa went to Rome in 1635 to study, but he soon contracted malaria. He returned to Naples, where he painted numerous battle and marine pictures and developed his peculiar style of landscape - picturesquely wild scenes of nature with shepherds, seamen, soldiers, or bandits - the whole infused with a romantic poetic quality. His reputation as a painter preceded his return to Rome in 1639. Already famous as an artist, he also became a popular comic actor. During the Carnival of 1639 he rashly satirized the famous architect and sculptor Gian Lorenzo Bernini, thereby making a powerful enemy. For some years thereafter the environment of Florence was more comfortable for him than that of Rome. In Florence he enjoyed the patronage of Cardinal Giovanni Carlo de' Medici. Rosa's own house became the centre of a literary, musical, and artistic circle called the Accademia dei Percossi; here also Rosa's flamboyant personality found expression in acting. In 1649 he returned and finally settled in Rome. Rosa, who had regarded his landscapes more as recreation than as serious art, now turned largely to religious and historical painting. In 1660 he began etching and completed a number of successful prints. His satires were posthumously published in 1710."

44682,Bernardino Lanino,1509,1583,"Italian painter and draughtsman. In 1528 Lanino was apprenticed to Baldassarre de Cadighis of Abbiategrasso in Vercelli, but from 1530 he was associated with Gaudenzio Ferrari, then the most important painter in Vercelli. Lomazzo claimed that Lanino was Gaudenzio's pupil. By 18 November 1533 he was already a master painter. His early works, such as the Virgin and Child with Saints (Turin, Galleria Sabauda), painted for S Eusebio, Ternengo, show how he had assimilated Gaudenzio's delicate effects, and interpreted them in soft, misty brushstrokes. After Gaudenzio moved to Lombardy (c. 1534) and later established himself in Milan (c. 1539-46), Lanino became the most active painter in the region; from this period date the Virgin and Child with Saints (1539), painted for SS Pietro e Paolo, Borgosesia (in situ), and Virgin and Child with Saints (1543; London, National Gallery), painted for Francesco Strata's chapel in S Paolo, Vercelli. Other altarpieces of this date include the Assumption of the Virgin (signed and dated 1543; Biella, S Sebastiano) and frescoes of scenes from the Life of the Virgin in Novara Cathedral (1546-53). Between 1540 and 1560, Lanino made several visits to Milan, creating altarpieces and frescoes. There he absorbed the strong influence of Leonardo da Vinci's chiaroscuro. During this period Lanino made many of his finest drawings, creating startling chiaroscuro effects using black chalk and white bodycolor heightening on brown prepared paper. He often used pen and wash with white highlights in his accomplished compositional studies. Throughout the 1560s and 1570s, patrons eagerly sought Lanino's paintings, and his workshop was amazingly prolific. Examples of his soft style spread throughout the eastern Piedmont and Milan, and his sons also became painters in Vercelli. "

In 1730 he was approved (agréé) by the Académie Royale, and on 30 July 1735 was received (reçu) on presenting as morceaux de réception engraved portraits of the painters Joseph Christophe after François-Hubert Drouais, and Louis de Boullogne the younger after Antoine Mathieu. In the same year he purchased the post of Contrôleur Général des Rentes at the Hôtel de Ville, Paris. He contributed to most of the engraved collections which appeared during his lifetime. He engraved both portraits and genre scenes, and was sought after for his careful style and his firm and precise lines. He owned a considerable collection of prints, which were sold by Pierre-François Basan in November 1769. His son Pierre-Louis de Surugue (1716-1772) was likewise an etcher and engraver, print-publisher and print-seller. He trained with his father and was received (reçu) by the Académie Royale on 30 September 1741. "

He was the son of the mayor of Gorinchem, and he became the best glass painter of his century, who went to great trouble to reinvent the techniques of Dirk Crabeth and his brother Wouter. Gorinchem and the surrounding towns all had examples of his stained glass work. Despite this talent and becoming mayor of Gorinchem himself, Ulft would go down in history for his own contributions to art in the area of oil painting and engraving old ruins, showing each crack and cranny. He painted many Italianate landscapes with monuments and triumphal arches, but these were based on Italianate prints, because according to Houbraken he had never been to Italy. He was registered in Gorinchem during the years 1652-1683. In 1658 he is registered as making sketches of heraldic shields for the city of Gorinchem, and in 1659 he is mentioned in a notarised document as being a painter and an architect. In 1679 he fled to The Hague for a short period due to accusations of corruption, and in 1683 he left Gorinchem definitely for Noordwijk, where he later died. "

He began his studies in painting in Paris, in 1768, in the studios of François Bernard Lépicié, Nicolas Guy Brenet and Francisco Casanova. At the age of 17, he dedicated himself to landscape painting. From 1777 onwards, he exhibited at the event known as 'Jeunesse' and at the Salon de la Correspondance, both of which were non-official. In 1784, he was accepted as an Associate of the Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture. This title allowed him to participate in official events, and also led to the award of a three-year pension at the Academy of the Palazzo Mancini, in Rome. In Italy, he made contact with the painter Jacques-Louis David, who at the time was painting The Oath of the Horatii. Returning to France in 1787, he exhibited in the Parisian Salons. In 1793, with the turbulent environment and the extinction of the institutions of the monarchy due to the French Revolution, he withdrew from Paris, returning in 1796 to join the recently created Institut de France. In 1805, he portrayed the campaigns of Napoleon in Germany. With the end of the Napoleonic empire, he went to Brazil as a member of the Missao Artística Francesa [French Artistic Mission], arriving in Rio de Janeiro in 1816 and becoming a pensioner of the King, Dom Joao VI (1767-1826) and a member of the Escola Real de Ciencias, Artes e Ofícios [Royal School of Sciences, Arts and Crafts], the future Academia Imperial de Belas Artes - Aiba [Imperial Academy of Fine Arts], where he occupied the chair of landscape painting. In 1821, after disagreements arising from the appointment of Henrique José da Silva (1772-1834) as director of the school, he returned to France. Despite his short stay in Brazil (1816-1821), his output of paintings with Brazilian themes is extremely important for the history of Brazilian art during the 19th century, principally with regard to the development of landscape painting.

In 1747 he travelled to Rome, where he met Joshua Reynolds and worked in the studio of Claude-Joseph Vernet, producing pastiches of Vernet's work and his own views of Tivoli. However, in 1755 Patch was banished from the Papal States for some homosexual act and settled in Florence. His friendship with the British envoy Sir Horace Mann provided him with introductions to English tourists, who commissioned copies after the Old Masters and views of Florence, such as the Piazza della Signoria (1763; City Museum and Art Gallery, Plymouth). During the 1760s he painted caricature groups of the painters, dealers and Grand Tourists of Anglo-Florentine society. He also made an extensive study of varying types of faces and expressions (destroyed). The caricatures are of a type also painted by Reynolds and include the Punch Party (1760; Dunham Massey, Cheshire) and Golden Asses (1761; Yale University, Lewis Walpole Library, New Haven); together with his two sets of engraved caricatures, they provide a light-hearted reminder of the serious physiognomical study. A further series of books of engravings after Masaccio, Fra Bartolommeo, Giotto and Ghiberti, produced in the 1770s, are evidence of Patch's scholarly interest in early Italian art. He was also engaged in art dealing. It seems that he painted little towards the end of his life. He died in Florence on 30th April 1782 after suffering a stroke and after a sojourn in Italy of 35 years. "

41224,Samuel van Hoogstraten,1627,1678,"Dutch painter and writer on art. He painted genre scenes in the style of de Hooch and Metsu, and portraits, but he is best known as a specialist in perspective effects. One of his ""perspective boxes"" which shows a painted toy world through a peep-hole, is in the National Gallery, London. Only in his early works can it be detected that he was a pupil of Rembrandt. Hoogstraten travelled to London, Vienna, and Rome, worked in Amsterdam and The Hague as well as his native Dordrecht, and was a man of many parts. He was an etcher, poet, director of the mint at Dordrecht, and art theorist. His Inleyding tot de hooge schoole der schilderkonst (Introduction to the Art of Painting, 1678) contains one of the rare contemporary appraisals of Rembrandt's work. "

34324,Gaspard Dughet,1615,1675,"French landscape painter, draughtsman, and etcher, born of French parents and active in Rome (called also Gaspard Poussin). He is one of the most difficult seventeenth-century artists to identify and define, even though he achieved success in his lifetime and his pictures continued to be in demand for two centuries after his death. He became associated with Nicolas Poussin (whose surname he adopted) at an early age because Poussin married Gaspard's sister, Anne-Marie Dughet, in 1630. It is assumed that Gaspard was taught to paint by his illustrious brother-in-law in the early 1630s, in spite of the fact that Poussin at that time was totally preoccupied with mythological and religious subject-matter, and had not turned his attention to landscapes. It is likely, therefore, as nothing but landscapes survive from Gaspard's hand, that he was the initiator of the classical landscape painting. These earliest essays may well be the group of pictures formerly put together as The Silver Birch Master, although there is now a theory that these works represent Poussin's earliest landscapes. The best-documented works by Gaspard are some landscape frescoes in the Roman church of S. Martino ai Monti, dating from the early 1650s. The superb series of landscapes in gouache in the Colonna Gallery in Rome show him at the height of his powers as a decorator. It has always been thought that Gaspard's cold, stylised pictures with intense blues and dark trees are his later works, all painted under the influence of Nicolas Poussin's classical landscapes of about 1650.

41674,Franz Anton Maulbertsch,1724,1796,"Maulbertsch (or Maulpertsch) was the outstanding Austrian decorative painter of the 18th century. He was active and extremely productive over a wide area of central Europe and most of his works (altarpieces as well as frescoes) are still in the churches and secular buildings in Austria, the Czech republic, Hungary, and Slovakia for which they were painted. Maulbertsch's vivacious, colourful, and emotional style was almost completely resistant to Neoclassical influences, representing the last glorious flowering of the Baroque and Rococo tradition. His painterly dash is even more apparent in his oil sketches, which are well represented in the Barockmuseum, Vienna, and he was also an outstanding etcher. His oeuvre is well represented in Hungary. A major work of his early period was a series of frescoes for the parish church of Sümeg (1757-59) followed by frescoes for the Erdõdy-castle and its chapel (1763), allegoric frescoes for the Féltorony-castle (1765), frescoes of the Gyõr cathedral (1772, 1781), the dome of the Vác cathedral (1774) ,  frescoes of St. Stephen for the parish church in Vác (1781-82) and frescoes of the episcopal see in Szombathely (1783). The frescoes of the chapel of the girls' school in Eger show the calmness of his late period (1792-93). "

About 35 paintings are generally attributed to him, consisting primarily of dated portraits of the English gentry and nobility. The majority are signed with the monogram HE, which led to their being attributed to the Flemish painter Lucas de Heere during the 18th and 19th centuries. "

11178,Benjamin Robert Haydon,1786,1846,"English painter, who aspired to bring a new seriousness to British art through historical and religious work in the Grand Manner preached by Reynolds. His life was a story of bombastic frustration and intransigent opposition to the establishment (particularly the Royal Academy), fighting continuously for personal recognition and arguing for the social purpose of art. As a painter, however, his talents fell far short of his ambitions, his multi-figure compositions degenerating into turgid melodrama. His great monument, rather, is the massive collection of autobiographical writings he left behind him (various editions have been published), which gives fascinating insights into the contemporary artistic scene and paints a vividly detailed picture of his disturbed mind and tragicomical life. He was closely linked with the Romantic movement in literature,  particularly with William Wordsworth, who wrote a sonnet to him, and with John Keats, doing portraits of both of them (National Portrait Gallery, London), and but for his lack of talent he would exemplify all the traits traditionally ascribed to the Romantic concept of genius. In true Romantic fashion his death came by suicide. "

34236,Maurice Denis,1870,1943,"French painter, designer and writer on art theory. Early in his career, he was a Symbolist and a member of the Nabis. In his article Definition of neo-Traditionalism (1890), he made a famous pronouncement on art, which has often been regarded as the key to contemporary aesthetics of painting: 'Remember that a picture - before being a warhorse or a nude woman or an anecdote - is essentially a flat surface covered with colours assembled in a certain order.' His early work did indeed put great emphasis on flat patterning, but he was also very much concerned with the subject matter, for he was a devout Catholic and set himself to revive religious painting. Denis's career as a painter was industrious and prolific. Exhibiting regularly with the Symbolists and Neo-Impressionists throughout the 1890s, he was quick to gain a reputation and following, at first among a restricted artistic and literary élite but later in wider Roman Catholic, official and international circles. In the wake of his first important private decorative commission in 1897 for the Paris hôtel of Baron Denys Cochin, the Legend of St Hubert (Musée Départemental du Prieuré, Saint-Germain-en-Laye), Denis was kept busy by a succession of decorative projects for religious and secular settings, notable among them being the enormous decorative scheme on the theme of the History of Music for the Théâtre des Champs-Elysées (1912-13; in situ) and the History of the French Arts for the cupola of the Petit Palais (1924-25; in situ). In 1917 he did frescoes for the church of St Paul in Geneva, and he also designed stained glass and church furnishings. His restoration of the 17th-century priory in Saint-Germain-en-Laye, which he was able to buy in 1914, involved him in the full range of decorative work implied within the original scope of the Nabi movement, studies for fresco and stained glass as well as designs for church furniture and ornaments. In 1980 the priory was established as the Musée Départemental du Prieuré, devoted to the works of Maurice Denis and the Nabis. For the most part, his writings on art are collected in Théories (1912) and Nouvelles Théories (1922). In 1939, he published a history of religious art. "
28215,Julian Alden Weir,1852,1919,"American painter, printmaker and teacher, part of a family of artists, son of Robert Walter Weir (1803-1889). His art education began in the studio of his father. There he and his half-brother John Ferguson Weir (1841-1926) acquired an appreciation for the Old Masters, particularly of the Italian Renaissance and of the 17th-century Dutch schools. While Weir pursued in his art a course very different from that of his father and half-brother, his personality as well as his artistic attitudes were shaped by them. In the winters of 1870-71 and 1871-72, he continued his studies at the National Academy of Design in New York, where his instructor was Lemuel Wilmarth (1835-1918). He continued his studies in 1873 in Paris under Gérôme. He practiced open air painting in Pont-Aven (Brittany) and Cernay-la-Ville, southwest of Paris. He became friends with Bastien-Lepage and Sargent. In 1875 he exhibited at the Paris Salon and the New York National Academy of Design. In 1877 he returned to New York and became member of the Society of American Artists, and in 1882 president of the Society. He engaged in the organization of exhibitions and exhibited there himself. He renewed travel in Europe in the 1870s and 1880s. From 1885 to 1889 he taught at the Cooper Institute. Weir founded his career as an artist primarily on portraits and still-lifes, but he also painted successful history works and family scenes. "

After employment at 19 as a scene painter at the Theatre Royal, he quickly moved to Cummnock where alongside MacNee and McCulloch he decorated snuffboxes for a living. Armed with a letter of introduction from David Roberts, he moved to London and was again employed as a scene painter, first at the Queen's Theatre and then at the Pavilion where he met Clarkson Stanfield (1793-1867) and attracted the patronage of a wealthy stockbroker. He began exhibiting at the Royal Academy in 1841. A trip to Italy in 1854 on health grounds let indirectly to his becoming drawing instructor to Queen Victoria and members of her household, lessons that continued for almost 20 years, receiving a Royal annuity in 1864.

He lived long enough to assimilate some of the qualities of Elsheimer's and Annibale Carracci's landscapes and his work bridges the gap between the fantastic 16th century Flemish Mannerist style and the more plausible, idealized Italian landscapes of the 17th century. He also made views of Rome for the tourist trade, and marine pictures. His conception of both of these subjects had considerable influence upon Agostino Tassi, the teacher of Claude Lorrain, and upon Claude himself. Paul's brother, Matthew or Matthijs, also worked in Rome, and their work is hard to differentiate. "

Matteo is first documented in Siena in 1452, when he was commissioned to gild an angel carved in wood by Jacopo della Quercia for Siena Cathedral. In 1457 he decorated the chapel of S Bernardino there. The modest nature of these projects suggests that he was still an apprentice. In this period he collaborated with Giovanni di Pietro, the brother of il Vecchietta, which supports the hypothesis that his early training was in the circle of il Vecchietta. His large surviving oeuvre exemplifies the development of Sienese painting in the 15th century from an emphasis on line and pattern to an early interest in the innovations of contemporary Florentine art. It has been suggested that he was first influenced by Umbrian painting of the mid-15th century, but he was already active in Siena by the early 1450s. This was a decade of transition in the artistic life of the city after the death of Sassetta, Domenico di Bartolo and Pietro di Giovanni d’Ambrogio and before the influx of new ideas during the pontificate of Pius II. His style was elegant, linear, and decorative, revealing affinities with Pollaiuolo, and he seems to have been one of the most popular and prolific Sienese painters of the second half of the 15th century.

40462,Guglielmo Caccia,1558,1635,"Italian painter, called Il Moncalvo. One of the most important and prolific Piedmontese artists of the first quarter of the 17th century, Gugielmo Caccia was probably trained in Casale Monferrato before moving to Vercelli. There he absorbed the influences of Gaudenzio Ferrari and Bernardino Lanino, as is evident in his decoration of one of the chapels of the Sacro Monte at Crea, completed around 1590. In 1593 he settled in the town of Moncalvo, from which he adopted his name. Between 1605 and 1608 he worked in Turin, collaborating with Federico Zuccaro and several other artists on the decoration of the vault of the Grande Galleria, the very long corridor linking the Palazzo Madama with the new Palazzo Ducale, with a series of forty-eight 'imagini celesti'. Commissioned by Carlo Emanuele I, Duke of Savoy, the decoration of the gallery, which was destroyed by fire in 1659, was to be the only major secular commission of Moncalvo's career. He also worked, on his own, in the Palazzo Madama and the Palazzo del Viccobone, although nothing survives of either project. Soon after his return to Piedmont, Moncalvo reached the height of his activity, painting frescoes and altarpieces for churches throughout Piedmont and Lombardy, notably San Marco in Novara and San Domenico in Chieri. He declined the opportunity to work on the Sacro Monti of Varallo and Orta, choosing instead to complete the decoration of the cupola of the church of San Vittore al Corpo in Milan, where he worked alongside Daniele Crespi. By 1620 he was back in Moncalvo, from where he continued to supply paintings for churches in Turin, Alessandria and elsewhere. He had several pupils, among whom was his daughter Orsola Maddalena, a nun in a local convent, who assisted him on a number of his late paintings. Significant groups of drawings by the artist are today in the collections of both the Biblioteca Reale and the Museo Civico d'Arte Antica in Turin, and the Escola de Belas Artes in Oporto, Portugal.

35562,Alessandro Magnasco,1667,1749,"Italian painter, called Il Lissandrino. He was born and died in Genoa, but spent most of his working life in Milan. Son of a minor Genoese painter, Alessandro Magnasco trained in his home town before moving to Milan when he was still young. There he worked for many years in Filippo Abbiati's studio. His meeting with Sebastiano Ricci marked a turning-point in his art. Their acquaintance was renewed during a stay in Florence (1703-09) at the court of Grand Duke Ferdinand of Tuscany. Soon afterwards, Magnasco gave up painting large figures (he only produced a handful of these in his later years) and instead concentrated on his unmistakable canvases with fantastic landscapes or interiors peopled with weird characters. At the start he stuck to windswept countryside and ruins with beggars. But during his second and longer stay in Milan (1709-35), he turned to the type of work for which he is now known - highly individual melodramatic scenes set in storm-tossed landscapes, ruins, convents, and gloomy monasteries, peopled with small elongated figures of monks, nuns, gypsies, mercenaries, witches, beggars, and inquisitors. His brushwork is nervous and flickering and his lighting effects macabre. His output was extremely well received in Milanese scholarly circles. He was very prolific and his work is rarely dated or datable. The critical jury is still out as to any deeper meaning of these canvases, which mingle the macabre with the burlesque, simple description with powerful melodrama. Magnasco went back to Genoa in old age and it is there that we find his last, visionary and transfigured works. His art later influenced Marco Ricci and Francesco Guardi. "

41859,Domenico Fetti,1584,1624,"Domenico Fetti (or Feti), Italian painter. He was born at Rome, where he studied under Ludovico Cigoli, was court painter to Vincenzo Gonzaga at Mantua from 1613 to 1622, and then settled in Venice. Mantua, this out-of-the-way location allowed him to develop a highly original style of painting where a variety of different influences blended together. He trained during the last days of Mannerism, but he was influenced decisively by Rubens' arrival in Italy. His dialogue with Rubens and more generally his interest in Flemish and Dutch painting gave rise to a rich and luminous way with his brushstrokes. Most of his canvases tended to be fairly small and these are perhaps more interesting than the larger works he produced, such as the frescos in Mantua cathedral or the large lunette showing The Miracle of the Loaves and Fishes in the Pallazzo Ducale in Mantua. He painted a splendid cycle on the Gospel parables for the same princely residence. Unfortunately the pictures have since been split between various museums - Dresden, Vienna, Prague, and Florence. His most characteristic works are of religious themes turned into genre scenes of contemporary life. Though small in scale, they are broadly painted, with characteristic 'windswept' brushstrokes. Their great popularity is shown by the fact that they often exist in numerous very similar versions (e.g. his famous Melancholy). Fetti, who was also an excellent portraitist, was one of a group of non-Venetian artists (including the German Liss and the Genoan Strozzi) who revivified painting in the city when there was a scarcity of native talent. Consequently, he is often classed as a member of the Venetian School, even though he spent only the last two years of his life there. "

33320,Arnold Böcklin,1827,1901,"Swiss painter. He was, with Ferdinand Hodler the major Swiss painter of the 19th century, and he exerted a great influence on the German-speaking countries through the expression of a heightened Romanticism and poeticism. He was trained in Germany, Flanders, and Paris, and spent seven years in Rome (1850-57), where he transformed his early naturalistic landscapes, more or less in the manner of Corot, into symbolic subjects with figures epitomizing the mood of the landscape. In the 1860s he visited Pompeii, where the ancient Roman frescoes led him to attempt classical history subjects, often harsh in colour. He married an Italian orphan named Angela. Their Catholic union created endless problems in the Protestant painter's hometown even though the couple mostly lived in Florence and Rome. Angela, who bore Böcklin eighteen children, resolutely opposed his working from any female model than herself. In 1866 he resided at Basle. He was in Munich in 1871-74, in 1885 in Hottingen (Switzerland). However, like other German artists of the period, he spent much of rest of his life in Italy, where he died in Fiesole near Florence. The work by which he is best known, The Island of the Dead, was first painted when he was living in Florence (1874-85) and was repeated in many versions. This painting partly evokes the English Cemetery, Florence, close to his studio and where his baby daughter Maria had been buried. It has a curiously haunted quality; the same quality can be found in his Pan (which also exists in several versions) and in some other landscapes. Most of his works are in his native Basle, where the Museum has a frescoed staircase and in Munich and other German museums. "

65385,May Morris,1862,1938,"English needlework artist and designer, second daughter of William Morris and Jane Morris. Brought up in London, she was educated at home until 1874. Her aptitude for art surfaced in her teens, and she attended the South Kensington School of Design from 1880 to 1883. In 1885 she took on responsibility for the embroidery section of her father's business. She was, with her father, chief designer of textiles at Morris, Marshall, Faulker & Co. (with wallpaper as her second string, e.g. Honeysuckle, 1883). She made many of the products herself and was especially involved in the making of the textile pieces for the annual Arts and Crafts Exhibitions from 1888. Of her family, she was the only one who both designed and worked in embroidery. May Morris became a leading name in the Arts and Crafts Movement of the 1880s and 1890s (despite its intermittent discrimination against women), writing on her craft (notably Decorative Needlework, 1893), as well as teaching it. She joined her father in the nascent English Socialist movement of the 1880s, becoming close to Eleanor Marx, her partner Edward Aveling and George Bernard Shaw in the more radical wing, the Socialist League. After a flirtation with Shaw, she married fellow activist Harry Sparling in 1890. A revival of her attraction to Shaw in 1893 led to her separation from Sparling, which resulted in divorce in 1898. After her father died in 1896, she did not inherit the business and from then on functioned as a freelance craft artist, teacher and writer, adding silversmithing and the making of jewellery to her portfolio. From 1899 she was connected with the Central School of Arts and Crafts in London, becoming head of its embroidery department in 1899, and gave occasional lectures on her specialism around the country and in the USA (1909-10). She was also a leading light in the Women's Guild of Arts (founded 1907) for 30 years. Between 1901 and 1915 she edited her father's collected works into 24 volumes, wrote further on her specialist field, tried her hand at play-writing (White Lies, 1903) and in 1936 published a two-volume biography of her father.

He grew up in Newark, and New York City, and received his first artistic training with John Jesse Barker (active 1815-56), an itinerant artist claiming to be a student of Thomas Sully. Inness's early attraction to the Old Masters, especially to Claude Lorrain, is evident in his landscapes of the 1840s. He went to Rome and Florence in 1847, and in 1854-55 he was in Paris, where he was influenced by the Barbizon School. He spent many years in Europe, with four years in France and Italy (1870-74). In his last decade he came under the influence of Swedenborg and as a result his landscapes took on Symbolist overtones. There are many works in Boston and in New York (Metropolitan Museum of Art) and other US museums, and one in London (National Gallery). "

Apart from a few portraits and some early hunting party and ""merry company"" scenes, his paintings are almost all elegant upper-class interiors, in which he showed off a skill in painting silks and satins to rival that of Terborch. His figures are extremely refined, but there is often a sexual element in his painting. "

He was an uninspired Mannerist painter, but he had a successful career by modelling his work on Italian masters such as Correggio and Parmigianino (The Mystic Marriage of St Catherine, Musées Royaux, Brussels, 1589). His love of Italian art and his scholarly inclinations (he often Latinized his name to Octavio Vaenius) must have been appreciated by Rubens, who had his final training in van Veen's studio. It was also van Veen who advised Rubens to go to Italy in 1600. "

By 1807 the family had moved to Greenwich where Harding spent much of his time drawing and painting in Greenwich Park. In 1811, at the age of 14, he exhibited for the first time at the Royal Academy. He had lessons in watercolour painting from Samuel Prout (1783-1852) and in 1816 he won the Society of Arts silver medal for landscape painting. He also learnt engraving from John Pye (1782-1874) and subsequently became a skilled engraver and lithographer. He was also largely engaged in teaching, counting John Ruskin amongst his pupils. Harding made his first trip to Italy in 1824, with Charles Hullmandel (1789-1850), and he made numerous trips to the Continent throughout his lifetime. He frequently contributed to the exhibitions of the Water-Colour Society, of which he became an associate in 1821 and a full member the following year. He published several books developing his views of art - amongst others: The Tourist in Italy (1831), The Tourist in France (1834), The Park and the Forest (1841), The Principles and the Practice of Art (1845), Elementary Art (1846), Scotland Delineated in a Series of Views (1847) and Lessons on Art (1849).

He travelled to Rome in 1715, where he spent much of his time making studies of ships (Paris, Musée des Arts Décoratifs) and even of Turks and camels (Paris, École National Supérieur des Beax-Arts). He also trained in the studio of Bernardino Fergioni (1674-1738) and learnt from those artists in the circle of the sculptor Pierre Legros, who was to purchase two seascapes by Manglard before 1719. His skill as a marine painter was such that his career advanced rapidly: prestigious clients included Victor Amadeus II, Duke of Savoy and King of Piedmont, who bought two matching pieces from him in 1726 (Turin, Galleria Sabauda), and Philip, Duke of Parma (d 1765), who acquired a pair in 1759 (Colorno, Palazzo Ducale), and the Rospigliosi family in Rome, for whom he produced a number of pictures (Rome, Museo Nazionale Romano). Manglard enjoyed considerable academic success, becoming a member of the Académie Royale in Paris in 1735, and of the Accademia di San Luca in Rome in 1736 the following year. He was also elected to the 'Congregazione dei Virtuosi del Pantheon' in 1741. He enjoyed also the patronage of most of the leading Roman families, including the Orsini, Chigi, Colonna, Rondanini, and Rospigliosi, as well as patrons from further afield such as Victor Amadeus II Duke of Savoy and King of Piedmont, and Filippo Bordone, Duke of Parma (who alone commissioned more than 140 works from Manglard to decorate his palazzi).

40566,James Ensor,1860,1949,"Belgian painter, printmaker and draughtsman. Trained in Brussels, he spent most of his life in his native Ostend. In 1883 he joined a group known as Les Vingt (The Twenty) and began depicting skeletons, phantoms, masks, and other images of grotesque fantasy as social commentary. His Entry of Christ into Brussels (1888), painted in smeared, garish colours, provoked outrage. No single label adequately describes the visionary work produced by Ensor between 1880 and 1900, his most productive period. His pictures from that time have both Symbolist and Realist aspects, and in spite of his dismissal of the Impressionists as 'superficial daubers' he was profoundly concerned with the effects of light. His imagery and technical procedures anticipated the colouristic brilliance and violent impact of Fauvism and German Expressionism and the psychological fantasies of Surrealism. Ensor's most memorable and influential work was almost exclusively produced before 1900, but he was largely unrecognised before the 1920s in his own country. His work was highly influential in Germany, however: Emil Nolde visited him in 1911, and was influenced by his use of masks; Paul Klee mentions him admiringly in his diaries; Erich Heckel came to see him in the middle of the war and painted his portrait (1930; Cologne, Wallraf-Richartz-Museum); Alfred Kubin owned several of his prints, while Marc Chagall and George Grosz also adapted certain elements from Ensor. All the artists of the Cobra group saw him as a master. He influenced many Belgian artists. "
68919,Georges Jacob,1739,1814,"French furniture maker. Despite his humble origins, Georges Jacob rose to become one of the most renowned menuisiers of his day. Unlike many artisans who joined their fathers or brothers in the middle-class family trade of furniture making, Jacob was from a peasant family and moved to Paris at sixteen to begin his career. He apprenticed in a joinery workshop and eventually became a master in 1765. He developed a reputation for producing inventive designs for chairs, beds, and screens carved with such motifs as twisted ribbons, guilloches, beading, and fluting. Jacob's reputation grew quickly, eventually spreading outside France; the future King George IV of England, Gustavus III of Sweden, and several German princes all ordered furniture from him. During the French Revolution, his debts mounted as several of his French clients fled the country or were executed. Despite his aristocratic business connections, which would have provoked suspicion from the revolutionary government, Jacob's friendship with the painter Jacques-Louis David helped him to avoid imprisonment, and he became one of the main suppliers of furniture to the revolutionary government and later to Emperor Napoleon. Jacob retired in 1796, turning his business over to his two sons, one of whom was François-Honoré-Georges Jacob, who later called himself Jacob Desmalter. When the older son died, Jacob returned to work and watched the firm become one of the most important of the period, supplying pieces to many wealthy residences and employing more than three hundred workmen.

However, his work is entirely different to that of Cosway, quiet and grey in its colouring, with the flesh tints elaborated with much subtlety and modelled in exquisite fashion. He possessed a great knowledge of anatomy, and his portraits are drawn with greater anatomical accuracy and possess more distinction than those of any miniature painter of his time. "

55764,Pieter de Grebber,1595,1653,"The eldest son of the history and portrait painter, Frans Pietersz de Grebber, and Hillegart Fredericxdr van Lijnhoven (d. 1643), Pieter de Grebber was born in Haarlem in ca. 1600. His sister Maria (ca. 1602-1680) and brother Albert (1613/14 - after 1649) also became painters, and his brother Maurits (c. 1604-1676) became a goldsmith. The family was devoutly Catholic and had close ties to the clergy. Frans de Grebber even sheltered the Amsterdam priest, Simon van Linteloo, in his house and permitted him to celebrate mass in their home. Pieter was a friend of the priest of the Begijnhof (a lay-order religious community), the noted musicologist Jan Albertsz Ban (1597/98-1644), and not only shared his interest in music, but also bought a house in the Beguinage in 1634, living there for the remainder of his life. Pieter first studied with his father before being apprenticed to the renowned history painter, draughtsman, and printmaker, Hendrick Goltzius. Frans de Grebber served as Peter Paul Rubens's agent, and young Pieter accompanied his father to Antwerp in 1618, where he met the great Flemish master. His earliest dated paintings are of 1622 (Mother and Child, Frans Halsmuseum, Haarlem; and Caritas, Museum of Fine Arts, Houston), but he did not join the Haarlem guild until 1632. Although it is undocumented, De Grebber probably worked in Denmark and his Belshazzar's Feast of 1625 came from Gottorf Castle in Schleswig, which was then Danish. Frans de Grebber was also a member of the Schoon-Vaerders Guild in Haarlem, a fraternal order originally founded by merchants who traded with Skane in southern Sweden, which also was then part of Denmark. In 1628 De Grebber painted his large Acts of Charity (Frans Halsmuseum) and Jacob, Rachel and Leah (Frans Halsmuseum) for the Old Men's Almshouse in Haarlem. Two years later he was commissioned by the municipal authorities to design a tapestry of the Conferring of the Cross on the Haarlem coat of arms and also apparently a painting of the Conferring of the sword on the Haarlem coat of arms. In 1637 he executed Elisha refusing Naaman's gifts (Frans Halsmuseum) for Haarlem's Leper House. De Grebber produced decorations for several royal palaces owned by the stadholder Frederik Hendrik, including Honselaarsdijk near Naaldwijk (1638), the Oude Hof, now Noordeinde Palace in The Hague (1646), and the Oranjezaal in Huis ten Bosch, also in The Hague (1648-1650) He also executed altarpieces for Flemish churches (Raising of Lazarus dated 1623, Onze Lieve Vrouwekerk, Bruges; and the Assumption dated 1648 from Sint Pieterskerk, Ghent, now in the Museum van Schone Kunsten, Ghent) and for schuilkerken, or hidden churches (The deposition dated 1633, Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam). Among De Grebber's approximately twenty surviving portraits are several of prominent Catholic priests. De Grebber won the praise of Philips Angel (Lofder Schilderkunst 1642) for his command of human anatomy. He also seems to have prospered financially, paying off the house that he purchased for 3,530 guilders in only four years and standing as guarantor for several of his father's business transactions. He also published a set of rules of art in 1649: Regulen: Welcke by een goet Schilder en Teyckenaer geobserveert en achtervolght moeten werden; Tesamen Qhestelt tot lust van de leergieriahe Discipelen (Rules to be observed and followed by the good artist and draughtsman, compiled for the pleasure of students with a thirst for learning). De Grebber never married and died some time between 24 September 1652 and 29 January 1653, when his home was sold. He made a will, but the document is lost and no inventory of his estate survives. In addition to his activity as a painter, De Grebber left many drawings and several etchings. Although only now regaining historical recognition, Pieter de Grebber was a highly regarded history and portrait painter in his day and distinguished himself as a pioneer of Haarlem classicism with a characteristic clarity and order in his designs, pale hued palette, and painterly execution in his mature works. His early paintings attest to his admiration for the Utrecht Caravaggisti, and he clearly had firsthand acquaintance with the achievements of both Rubens and Rembrandt, but his own style, which he had perfected by the mid-1620s, was unique, not merely an amalgam of Northern and Southern Netherlandish elements.

There is no evidence to support the tradition that he lived in Rome about 1627/28 in the same house as Claude Lorrain, but it is certain that he had contact with other French artists as well as Netherlandish ones in the city. During the beginning of the 1630s his development runs parallel to Claude's, and in some ways even anticipates it. During the thirties, as Swanevelt refined his idyllic landscape style, he worked for princely patrons. The plum was his commission from an agent of Philip IV who was helping the Spanish king assemble the colossal number of paintings needed to help decorate Buen Retiro, Philip's grandiose new palace in Madrid. Among the works ordered for the king were two series of landscapes, one of large-scale pastoral scenes, the other of anchorites in naturalistic settings. Together the two groups numbered more than fifty paintings. Swanevelt contributed to both series. When we consider that Philip acquired about 800 paintings to ornament his new palace, including Velázquez's Surrender of Breda and a host of other masterworks, the landscape commission may appear little more than a a touch of gilt added to the king's new golden house. But not so. Other artists who worked on the project include Claude, Poussin, Gaspar Dughet, and Jan Both. What remains of the ensemble gives the best idea of the achievement of the major landscapists active in Rome during the 1630s. It also was the largest, most spectacular landscape commission awarded in Europe during the seventeenth century. After leaving Rome for Paris in 1641 the remainder of Swanevelt's career was mainly spent in the French capital where his paintings and etchings helped to popularise classical landscape in the north. His high-placed Parisian patrons included Cardinal Richelieu; he became 'peintre ordinaire' to Louis XIV, and, in 1651, a member of the Académie Royale. Swanevelt made a few trips to his birthplace Woerden before his death in Paris in 1655, and, when in Holland, this pioneer of the 'ideal landscape' also painted 'Dutch' scenery. "

His aims, style and development are characteristic of the Barbizon School, of which he was one of the principal members. Like others in the group he suffered great hardship as a result of his attempts to introduce a non-academic landscape style, although this did not make him any more understanding or friendly to the Impressionists in later years. He was known as 'le grand refusé', because of his systematic exclusion from the Paris Salon between 1836 and 1841 and his abstention between 1842 and 1849. From 1863 he was deeply interested in Japanese art, at the time when it was just becoming known in Europe. "

After training at the Douglas School of Art, Isle of Man (1878-84), he moved to London in 1897, where he worked as a designer for, among others, the Silver Studio and taught at Redhill and Kingston art schools. His important association with Arthur Lasenby Liberty (1843-1917)began in 1901 with his designs for the Celtic-inspired Cymric collection of silver and jewellery and the Tudric domestic pewterware introduced by Liberty in 1903. His interpretation of Celtic forms was the closest approach to true English Art Nouveau, his disciplined use of Runic patterns contrasting with the excesses of the continental versions of the style. Knox was the most outstanding of Liberty's creative artists, producing over 400 designs for carpets, fabrics and metalwork from 1904 to 1912. In 1912 he resigned from his teaching post at Kingston College of Art following criticism of his teaching style and results. A group of his students also left in protest at his resignation and formed the Knox Guild of Craft and Design, which held successful annual exhibitions from 1913 until the beginning of World War II in 1939. Following his resignation, Knox visited the USA, returning to the Isle of Man to teach in 1913. In 1917 he designed Arthur Liberty's gravestone for the churchyard at The Lee, Buckinghamshire. "

43063,Henri Chapu,1833,1891,"French sculptor. His father, a coachman, sent him to the Petite École (École Gratuite de Dessin), Paris, to have him trained as a tapestry-maker. In 1849 his successes led him to the École des Beaux-Arts, Paris, where he became a pupil of James Pradier, François Duret and Léon Cogniet. In 1855 he won the Prix de Rome for sculpture with the relief Cleobis and Biton (plaster, untraced; sketch model, Le Mée-sur-Seine, Musée Henri Chapu); he completed his education at the Académie de France in Rome, remaining there until 1861. During this time he lived as a virtual recluse, his only friend being the painter Léon Bonnat. The bas-relief Christ with Angels (plaster, 1857; Le Mée-sur-Seine, Musée Henri Chapu), which was the first of the works he was required to send for judgement at the École des Beaux-Arts, was strongly criticized by Duret; it now appears to be one of the most sensitive sculptures of a classicizing artist, whose other Roman works included a copy of the antique Spinario (marble, 1858; Paris, École Nationale Supérieure des Beaux-Arts) and the much-exhibited statue of Mercury Inventing the Caduceus (marble, 1862-3; Paris, Musée d'Orsay). His statues Mercury of 1862 and Jeanne d'Arc of 1870 (in which she was represented as a peasant girl) were his first big successes, and led to many commissions thereafter. He is also known for his medals, and led the French revival in the medal as an artistic form. "

25108,James Stuart,1713,1788,"English architect, archaeologist, and designer, also known as Athenian Stuart. He was born to a Scottish sailor who died when he was young. Proving a talented artist while his family was in poverty, he was apprenticed to a fan painter to support the family financially. However, in around 1742, he was able to travel to Italy (albeit on foot) for his artistic improvement, working there as a cicerone and a painter, learning Latin, Italian and Greek, and studying Italian and Roman art and architecture. There he met Nicholas Revett (1720-1804), a young East Anglian nobleman and amateur architect on his Grand Tour. In 1748 Stuart joined Revett, Gavin Hamilton and the architect Matthew Brettingham the Younger (1725-1803) on a trip to Naples to study the ancient ruins and, from there, they travelled through the Balkans (stopping at Pula) to Greece. Visiting Salonica, Athens, and an Ionic temple on the River Ilissus among others, they made accurate measurements and drawings of the ancient ruins. Stuart and Revett returned to London in 1755 and published their work, The Antiquities of Athens and Other Monuments of Greece, in 1762, which later helped fuel the Greek Revival in European architecture. Its illustrations were among the first of their kind and the work was welcomed by antiquaries, scholars, and gentleman amateurs. In 1758 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. On his return to England, he also acted as an interior designer, medal designer, and architect, creating the first tripod in metal since antiquity, building and remodeling country houses, garden buildings, and town houses (e.g. Shugborough Hall, Hagley Hall, Spencer House), creating book illustrations, designing commemorative medals and tomb monuments, and being appointed Surveyor to the Royal Naval Hospital, Greenwich. Stuart's more and more chaotic business practices attracted adverse comment from the late 1760s. Enemies even accused him of 'Epicureanism' in reference to his alcoholism and recent second marriage at 67 to Elizabeth, a maidservant of 20. He died suddenly in 1788. Stuart's  London buildings played some part in popularising Neoclassical taste. His four-volume book ""Antiquities of Athens,"" co-written with Nicholas Revett, is considered the first accurate record of classical Greek architecture. "

In 1639 van der Lisse moved to The Hague, where he was a founder-member of the painters' confraternity Pictura in 1656; he became Burgomaster of the city in 1660. "

The prints were published in 1777 by John Boydell in two volumes under the title of Liber veritatis. "

After his father's death in 1602, he trained in Rome with his uncle Annibale, whom he probably assisted on the wall frescoes in the Galleria Farnese (1603-04) and on decorations in the Palazzo Mattei di Giove (1606). After a brief visit to Bologna in 1609-10, Antonio returned to Rome where he worked for the remainder of his short career. Under Guido Reni's supervision he painted a series of Virtues and other subsidiary figures in the Cappella dell'Annunciata in the Palazzo del Quirinale (1609-10). Soon after he did the ceiling fresco of God the Father with Saints in the sacristy of San Sebastiano fuori le Mura (c. 1611). For Cardinal Michelangelo Tonti, he created the altarpiece of St Bartholomew Kneeling in Adoration and the fresco decoration for three small chapels in San Bartolomeo dell'Isola in Rome, dedicated to the Passion of Christ, the Virgin and St Carlo Borromeo (c. 1611-15). In 1616 Antonio was again active in the Palazzo Quirinale, where for Pope Paul V he painted frescoes with scenes from the Old Testament in the so-called Stanza del Diluvio. Though at times confused with other members of the Carracci family, Antonio's oeuvre includes notable easel paintings, such as Alexander with King Porus (c. 1616, private collection), commissioned by Cardinal Alessandro Montalto; The Flood, a copy of his earlier fresco in the Palazzo del Quirinale (1616-17, Musée du Louvre, Paris); and The Death of St Cecilia (Musée Fabre, Montpellier).

34060,Charles-Antoine Coypel,1694,1752,"Coypel, family of French painter of which Noel was the head. He created a successful academic style on the example of Poussin and Le Brun. He was employed on the large decorative schemes of Louis XIV, notably at Versailles, and was director of the French Academy in Rome (1672-76) and then director of the Académie Royale in Paris (1695). Noel's son, Antoine went to Rome as a child with his father and there is a strong Italian element in his style. This comes out particularly in his most famous work, the ceiling of the Chapel at Versailles (1708) which derived from Baciccio's ceiling in the Gesù in Rome. This and Coypel's decorations at the Palais Royal in Paris (1702, destroyed) rank as the two most completely baroque schemes found in French art of this period. The Versailles ceiling is more successful than much of Coypel's work, which often combines the bombast of the Baroque and the pedantry of the classical style without the virtues of either. Antoine's half-brother, Noel-Nicolas painted with much more charm, mainly mythological subjects, but he seems to have had a rather timid personality and did not achieve the worldly success of the other members of the family. Indeed, he was the best painter of the family, but is the least famous. Chardin was briefly his assistant. Antoine's son Charles-Antoine was a much more forceful character than Noel-Nicolas and had a resoundingly successful career, largely due to his administrative capacity in the various official positions that he held. In 1747 he became director of the Académie Royale and chief painter to the king. He also was an accomplished writer of verse and plays as well as art criticism. As a painter he was versatile and prolific, but the weakest member of the family, his Supper at Emmaus (1746) in Saint-Merry, Paris, has been described as 'pathetically inept'."

36289,Augustus Charles Pugin,1762,1832,"English architect, illustrator, painter, draughtsman, designer and teacher. He was born in Paris, but his father was Swiss, and Pugin himself was to spend most of his life in England. Pugin left France during the Revolutionary period for unclear reasons about 1798 and later entered the Royal Academy Schools in London to improve his skills. Shortly afterwards he obtained a position as an architectural draughtsman with the architect John Nash. After considering and abandoning a career in architecture Pugin married and settled on a career as a commercial artist working primarily for publishers of illustrated books. He was a skilful watercolourist as well as an accomplished draftsman.
 
Pugin produced views of London, jointly creating the illustrations for the Microcosm of London (1808-1811) published by Rudolph Ackermann, followed by plates for Ackermann's books about Westminster Abbey, Oxford and Cambridge universities, and Winchester College. He often collaborated with other artists, notably Thomas Rowlandson. His later works included illustrations for Specimens of Gothic Architecture (1821-23), The Royal Pavilion at Brighton (1826), Architectural Antiquities of Great Britain (1826), Specimens of the Architectural Antiquities of Normandy (1827), Illustrations of the Public Buildings of London (1825 to 1828), and Paris and its Environs (1829 to 1831), and Examples of Gothic Architecture (1831). He also produced a book of furniture designs called Gothic Furniture, and assisted architects with detailing for their Gothic designs. He ran a drawing school at his house in Great Russell Street, Bloomsbury. Pugin, along with James Morgan (active 1806-1834). also designed the Diorama building in Regent's Park in 1823, to house and display the Dioramas of Louis Jacques Mandé Daguerre (1787-1851), a year after the debut of his Paris original in 1822. These exhibitions in London displayed eight of the Daguerre Dioramas (1823-1832), which were also exhibited on tour in Liverpool, Manchester, Dublin and Edinburgh (1825-1836).
 
Pugin married Catherine Welby of the Lincolnshire Welby family of Denton and his developing interest in the Gothic was to be magnified in the career of their son Augustus Welby Northmore Pugin, an architect who was the leading advocate of Gothicism in 19th-century England and the designer of the Palace of Westminster, home of the United Kingdom Parliament. His son also sometimes assisted him in some of his publications. Pugin's achievement as a practicing architect was not great, but he probably provided designs for other architects, such as the Gothic mausoleum for Princess Charlotte (Claremont, Surrey, 1817; destroyed), which was carried out by John Buonarotti Papworth (1775-1847). In 1826-27 he exhibited three designs for cemeteries, and early in 1830 he was associated with the layout of the cemetery at Kensal Green, London. He also had considerable interests in the decorative arts and is known to have designed furniture. "

36266,Maurice Brazil Prendergast,1859,1924,"American painter, born in Canada, educated in Boston. In 1886 he worked his way to Europe on a cattle boat and studied in Paris at Julian's and at the Colarossi Academy. His brother, Charles Prendergast (1869-1948), an artist and frame maker, often assisted him financially. He again went abroad in the early 1890s, and during the rest of his life he gravitated between New York City and Europe, visiting various countries. In New York he joined the independent group of artists called The Eight. Prendergast evolved a style akin to Post-Impressionism. Much freer in his brushstroke, his landscapes and figure compositions evoked the quality of a gay tapestry. Prendergast's work was strongly associated from the beginning with leisurely scenes set on beaches and in parks. His early work was mostly in watercolour or monotype, and he produced over two hundred monotypes between 1895 and 1902. He also experimented with oil painting in the 1890s, but did not focus on that medium until the early 1900s. He developed and continued to elaborate a highly personal style, with boldly contrasting, jewel-like colours, and flattened, patternlike forms rhythmically arranged on a canvas. Forms were radically simplified and presented in flat areas of bright, unmodulated colour. His paintings have been aptly described as tapestry-like or resembling mosaics. He is well represented in the Barnes Foundation, Merion, Pa., and in other leading collections throughout the United States. "

He trained at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts (1877-78), Philadelphia, where he became a friend of William Michael Harnett whose work was a dominant influence on his oeuvre. Peto maintained a studio in Philadelphia, exhibiting at the Academy from 1879 to 1887; he earned a living through occasional work as a photographer, sculptor and painter. After moving to Island Heights, NJ, in 1889, he stopped exhibiting at the Academy and sank into obscurity. While Peto's oeuvre reveals him starting out from the genre of trompe-l'oeil in the manner of Harnett, it shows him arriving, in his  latter years at a style closer to the maxims of the avant-garde. Many of his paintings which are close to the style of Harnett were for a long time attributed to the latter. "

She studied with Catharine Ann Drinker (1871), Francis Adolf van der Wielen (1872-73) and Camille Piton (1879), at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in Philadelphia (1877-78), and privately with William Sartain (1881-83). Under Sartain's guidance, she learnt to paint, producing her first major portrait, the Last Days of Infancy (1883-5; private collection). She completed her art training in Paris at the Académie Julian and the Académie Colorossi (1888-89). She had the coaching of painters like Robert-Fleury, Bouguereau and Dagnan Bouveret. In 1890 she exhibited at the Paris Exposition. Returning to Philadelphia, she obtained in 1893 the gold medal of the Philadelphia Art Club, and also the Dodge prize at the New York National Academy, and later various other distinctions. She became a member of the National Academy of Design, New York, in 1902. Among her portraits are those of Bishop-Coadjutor Greer (exhibited at the Salon in 1896); Mrs Roosevelt and her daughter; and Mrs Larz Anderson. Her Dorothea and Francesca, and Ernesta and her Little Brother, are good examples of her skill in painting children. "

42218,Pisanello,1390,1460," Italian painter, draftsman, and medallist (originally Antonio Pisano), who was the last and most brilliant artist of the ornate, courtly International Gothic style. He presumably came from Pisa (hence his nickname, he was originally named Antonio Pisano), but he spent his early years in Verona, a city with which he kept up his association for most of his life. He studied under Gentile da Fabriano, whose graceful, detailed style he inherited. His successful career also took him to the Vatican and numerous courts of northern Italy. With Gentile da Fabriano, Pisanello is regarded as the foremost exponent of the International Gothic style in Italian painting, but most of his major works have perished, including frescoes in Venice (in which he collaborated with Gentile) and in Rome (in which he completed work left unfinished by Gentile at his death). His surviving documented frescoes are The Annunciation (S. Fermo, Verona, 1423-4) and St George and the Princess of Trebizond (Sta Anastasia, Verona, 1437-38), and attributed to him are some fragments of murals of jousting knights in the Palazzo Ducale in Mantua, uncovered in 1968 and one of the most spectacular art discoveries of the period. A very small number of panel paintings is also given to him, two being in the National Gallery, London. On the other hand, a good many of his drawings survive, those of animals being particularly memorable. They show his keen eye for detail and his ability to convey an animal's personality. In drawings of female nudes he achieves a strength of three-dimensional modeling that establishes an important link between the Gothic and Renaissance styles. Pisanello was also the greatest portrait medallist of his period and arguably of the whole Renaissance, his work setting standards of delicacy, precision, and clarity that have not been surpassed. "
106440,Jean Beaumont,1897,1989,
37318,Richard Wilson,1714,1782,"One of the earliest major British landscape painters, whose works combine a mood of classical serenity with picturesque effects. In 1729 Wilson studied portraiture with Thomas Wright in London and after about 1735 worked on his own in this genre. From 1746 his work shows a growing interest in landscape that, soon after his arrival in Italy late in 1750, became almost exclusive. Staying at first in Venice, he met the landscape painter Francesco Zuccarelli. Early in 1752 he went to Rome and became part of an art circle that included the painters Joseph Vernet and Anton Raphael Mengs. He remained in Rome until 1757, working mostly for aristocratic English tourists. He produced not only large landscapes in the manner of Nicolas Poussin, Salvator Rosa, and Claude Lorrain but also numerous drawings of Roman sites and buildings, which he used in composing Italianate landscapes after his return to England. The finest of these is a set of drawings made for Lord Dartmouth and dated 1754. They show how Wilson tempered his delicate observation of light and distance with the discipline of such 17th-century classical Baroque painters as Poussin and Claude. Returning to London probably in 1757, he became influential as a teacher and, after 1760, as an exhibitor with the Society of Artists and the Royal Academy. He was a founding member of the academy in 1768 and, from 1776, its librarian, a post he took to relieve his poverty. Though continuing to produce Italian landscapes, Wilson now turned to depicting his own country, especially Wales and the rural environs of London. The order and clarity rather than the classical apparatus of Italy survive, and Wilson's exact and tranquil recording of clear or suffused air, distance, and varied lights predominates, as in his famed Snowdon. His landscapes of this period exerted considerable influence on J.M.W. Turner, John Constable, and John Crome. Wilson's later works, such as Minchenden House, tend to abandon formal composition, using tonal methods of recording space. Many works ascribed to him, especially late ones, are partly the work of his pupils. "
48615,Charles Angrand,1855,1926,"French painter, son of a country school teacher. He was trained at the Académie de Peinture et de Dessin in Rouen, where he won prizes. Although he failed to gain entry to the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris, Angrand began to win a controversial local reputation for canvases in a loosely Impressionist manner. In 1882 he secured a post as a schoolteacher at the Collège Chaptal in Paris. With this security he was able to make contacts in progressive artistic circles, and in 1884 he became a founder-member of the Salon des Indépendants. His paintings of this period depict rural interiors and kitchen gardens, combining the broken brushwork of Monet and Camille Pissarro with the tonal structure of Bastien-Lepage (e.g. In the Garden, 1884; private collection). He exhibited in the first Salon des Indépendants in 1884, and made his name known after the group exhibition in 1886. During his lifetime, he exhibited not only paintings but also pastels. Angrand adopted Seurat's divisionism, a systematic, scientific method using the technique of pointillism, i.e., application of unmixed pigments juxtaposed in dots. In order to obtain the utmost luminosity and brilliance of colour, small dots of unmixed pigments, applied to the canvas blend optically in the spectator's eye. Developing a highly personal approach to divisionism, Angrand began using larger brush-strokes around 1904. The result was similar to that achieved by dots, but the optical blending was less smooth. He tried to compensate for this by greater intensity of colour. Up to 1900 his painting of form became increasingly pointillist, thereafter he returned to an almost traditional technique with simple forms. "

He was a pupil of Albani, but he was inspired chiefly by Raphael, and with the sculptors Algardi and Duquesnoy he became the chief exponent of the style sometimes called 'High Baroque Classicism'. In defence of the classical princples of order and moderation, Sacchi engaged in a controversy in the Academy of St Luke with Pietro da Cortona on the question of whether history paintings should have few figures (as Sacchi maintained) or many (Cortona). Sacchi's ideas were more immediately influential, but his ponderous ceiling fresco of Divine Wisdom (1629-33) in the Palazzo Barberini in Rome is completely outshone by Cortona's exhilarating ceiling of the Grand Salone in the same building. Sacchi, indeed, was at his best on a much smaller scale - in altarpieces such as the grave, introspective Vision of St Romuald (Vatican, c. 1631) and in portraits. His most important pupil was Maratti. Sacchi also worked as an architect, designing the Chapel of St Catherine of Siena (1637-39) in the Sacristy of Sta Maria sopra Minerva, a work of refined classical purity. He was a fine draughtsman.

41571,Charles Landseer,1799,1879,"English painter, part of a family of artists, brother of Sir Edwin Landseer. He trained initially with his father John Landseer (c. 1769-1852), then under Benjamin Robert Haydon, and in 1816 he attended the Royal Academy Schools in London. In 1823 he accompanied Sir Charles Stuart de Rothesay (1779-1845) aboard HMS Wellesley on a voyage to Portugal and then to Brazil, in order to negotiate a commercial treaty with Pedro I, Emperor of Brazil (reg. 1822-1831). Many of the drawings he made on this trip were exhibited in 1828 at the British Institution, and in that year he sent his first painting to the Royal Academy. This was Dorothea, illustrating a scene from Cervantes's Don Quixote. He continued to exhibit at the Academy until his death, showing mostly romanticized history paintings (e.g. the Plundering of Basing House, 1645, 1836; London, Tate Gallery) or such literary subjects as Clarissa Harlowe in the Sponging House (1833; London, Tate Gallery), from Samuel Richardson's novel Clarissa (London, 1748). The English Civil War (1642-51) was of particular interest to him, his devotion to such historical subjects perhaps being attributable to the influence of his years with Haydon. Landseer also painted portraits, genre scenes and animal studies (e.g. Bloodhound and Pups, 1839; London, Tate Gallery). In 1837 he was elected ARA and in 1845 RA. In 1851, probably due to the influence of his brother Edwin, he succeeded George Jones as Keeper of the Royal Academy Schools. Responsible for instructing the antique class, his tenure was criticized both for the way his position had been obtained and for the deficiency of his teaching, and he retired from the Keepership in 1873 on full salary. He bequeathed 10,000 guineas to the Royal Academy for the foundation of the Landseer Scholarships, the money coming largely from his inheritance from Edwin. "

He engraved plates of historical subject matter, vistas and genre scenes, although the folder bearing his name in the British Museum's drawings and prints department barely contains a dozen work. The most noteworthy of these, owing to their size, ambition, and impact, are the engravings made of the Salons of the Louvre of 1785 and 1787, and on the Exhibition of the Royal Academy in London of 1787 and 1788. These four engravings are his most famous and considered his masterpieces. Although his name has long since been forgotten, he must have enjoyed a certain reputation during his lifetime, as he appears in the 1789 edition of Basan's dictionary of engravers, which tells us that he was also the author of works on the history of Romans, as well as landscapes and seascapes based on paintings by Vernet.

33530,Thomas Barker,1769,1847,"Thomas Barker of Bath, English painter and lithographer. He received his early training through the patronage of the Bath auctioneer Charles Spackman, whom he depicted in a joint portrait Thomas Barker and his Preceptor, Charles Spackman (1789; Bath, Victoria Art Gallery). Under Spackman's direction, Barker assiduously copied paintings by the Old Masters, gaining a proficient, if somewhat eclectic technique. The influence of Thomas Gainsborough in particular is evident in such early works as Woodman in a Storm (1789; London, Tate). He studied in Italy from 1790 to 1793, but there is little sign of any artistic development in paintings executed after his return to Bath. His most innovative works are Impressions of Rustic Figures after Nature (1813), the first one-man collection of lithographs printed in England, and the Massacre of the Inhabitants of Scio by the Turks (1825), a fresco painted on the walls of the picture gallery in his home, Doric House, Sion Hill, Bath (in situ). As an expert on fresco technique, Barker advised on the redecoration of the Houses of Parliament in 1841. In later years his popularity declined, and he died in poverty. "

64404,Isaia da Pisa,,,"Italian sculptor. His grandfather, Giovanni di Gante, was a stone-carver, and his father, Pippo di Giovanni de Ghante da Pisa, who worked with Donatello on the Brancacci monument in the Baptistery in Florence in 1426, was documented at the Vatican in 1431. This suggests that Isaia was taken to Rome as a youth. He was probably active as a sculptor before 1447, since Filarete, who was forced to flee Rome at that date, mentioned Isaia in his Trattato. Isaia's oeuvre is not easy to define, because the sculptures for which payments exist were all collaborative works. However, a corpus has been assembled, based in part on the style of one of the lunette reliefs from the Tabernacle of St Andrew (Rome, Grotte Vaticane), a project on which he collaborated with Paolo Romano in 1463-64. Porcellio Pandone wrote a poem in his honour (Ad immortalitatem Isaiae Pisani marmorum celatoris) in which, in the tradition of humanist hyperbole, he compared him to Pheidias, Polykleitos and Praxiteles. Although his work has been called monotonous, the influence of late Roman sculpture on Isaia's style reflects the classicizing taste of his time. "

His range was wide, including history paintings, genre scenes (notably of markets) and portraits, but after he settled in Amsterdam he concentrated on architectural paintings (primarily church interiors, both real and imaginary). His paintings are very different in spirit from the sober views of most Dutch architectural specialists, making powerful use of the dramatic play of light and shadow in the lofty interiors. His life was unhappy (he was constantly in debt) and when his body was found in an Amsterdam canal it was suspected that he had committed suicide. "

34563,Caspar David Friedrich,1774,1840,"The greatest German Romantic painter and one of the most original geniuses in the history of landscape painting. He was born at Greifswald on the Baltic coast, and after studying at the Copenhagen Academy with Juel and Abildgaard from 1794 to 1798, he settled permanently in Dresden. There he led a quiet life, interrupted only by occasional excursions to the mountains or the coast of Pomerania, pursuing with a rare and instinctive single-mindedness his personal insight into the spiritual significance of landscape. He was intensely introspective and often melancholic (although his marriage at the age of 44 brought him much happiness), and he relied on deep contemplation to summon up mentally the images he was to put on canvas. 'Close your bodily eye, so that you may see your picture first with your spiritual eye', he wrote, 'then bring to the light of day that which you have seen in the darkness so that it may react on others from the outside inwards.' Friedrich began with topographical drawings in pencil and sepia wash and did not take up oil painting until 1807. One of his first works in the new medium, The Cross in the Mountains (Staatliche Kunstsammlungen, Dresden, 1808), caused great controversy because it was painted as an altarpiece, and to use a landscape in this unprecedented way was considered sacrilege by some critics. His choice of subjects often broke new ground and he discovered aspects of nature so far unseen: an infinite stretch of sea or mountains, snow-covered or fog-bound plains seen in the strange light of sunrise, dusk, or moonlight. He seldom uses obvious religious imagery, but his landscapes convey a sense of haunting spirituality. Friedrich had a severe stroke in 1835 and returned to his small sepias. He was virtually forgotten at the time of his death and his immediate influence was confined to members of his circle in Dresden, notably Georg Friedrich Kersting, who sometimes painted the figures in Friedrich's work. It was only at the end of the 19th century, with the rise of Symbolism, that his greatness began to be recognized. Most of his work is still in Germany. "

65096,Simone Peterzano,1535,1644,"Italian painter. He claimed to have trained with Titian in Venice, but his first known works, the scenes from the Lives of Sts Paul and Barnabas (1573; Milan, San Barnaba), were painted in Milan, where he was established by 1575; these works indicate closer contacts with Jacopo Tintoretto, Brescian Renaissance artists, particularly Moretto, and Milanese Mannerist painters. Between 1578 and 1582 he painted frescoes and altarpieces for the charterhouse of Garegnano, near Milan, and in these established his mature style, which developed very little. He united elements of Antonio Campi's naturalism with Mannerist formulas partly influenced by Giovanni Demio (at Garegnano most marked in the angels he depicted on the dome), and thus achieved a lively narrative style, as in the Adoration of the Shepherds and the Adoration of the Magi. His Deposition (Milan, San Fedele) perhaps dates from 1583-84, but, although it is signed S Petrazanus Titiani Al[umnus] (i.e. pupil of Titian), it is closer to the work of Moretto. In 1584 Caravaggio entered his workshop on a four-year contract. The absence of any works or documents between 19 Feb 1585 and 26 Sept 1589 has led scholars to suggest a long stay in Rome. "

40788,Henri Rousseau,1844,1910,"French painter, called Le Douanier [the customs officer] the epithet his friends later used although he was a tax collector for more than 20 years before he retired to paint (1893). He was an ambitious, self-taught naive painter. Rousseau admired past academic artists like Bouguereau, and took direct inspiration from the Jardin des Plantes, but he was adopted by the leaders of modern art, with Apollinaire often acting as publicist. Rousseau measured Apollinaire for his portrait alongside Marie Laurencin in La Muse inspirant le poete: the resemblance is gauche yet unmistakable. Although he claimed to have lived in Mexico in his youth, he later admitted that the claim was false. The only tropical vegetation Rousseau ever saw was in Parisian greenhouses, and his remarkable landscapes had no counterpart in nature. His painted jungles are an organized profusion of carefully defined yet fantastic plants, half-concealing various wild animals with startlingly staring eyes. These scenes are rendered in a vivid, almost hypnotic folk style. The finest ones include The Snake Charmer (1907; Musée du Louvre, Paris) and The Dream (1910; Museum of Modern Art, New York). With the same approach Rousseau employed in painting the familiar (e.g., Village Street Scene, 1909; Philadelphia Museum of Art), he painted the haunting and dreamlike Sleeping Gypsy (1897; Museum of Modern Art, New York). Rousseau exhibited at the Salon des Indépendants from 1886, but did not become well known until the early years of the 20th century when he was ""taken up"" by Picasso, Apollinaire, and other members of the Parisian avant garde. In his honour Picasso organised a banquet in the Bateau-Lavoir in 1908, attended by artists and writers. He died a pauper. "

72753,Friedrich von Gärtner,1792,1847,"German architect, who worked in the Romantic Neoclassical style. His father was also an architect, and moved in 1804 to Munich, where young Gärtner received his first education in architecture (1808-12) under Karl von Fischer (1782-1820). After training with Weinbrenner in Karlsruhe (1812-13), he went in 1814 to Paris, where he studied under Percier and Fontaine, before making the obligatory tour of Italy, where he spent four years in the earnest study of antiquities. The fruits of this labour appeared in 1819 in some views accompanied by descriptions of the principal monuments of Sicily (Ansichten der am meisten erhaltenen Monumente Siciliens). His stay in Italy was followed by a visit to The Netherlands and England, where he was fascinated by industrial architecture. He then settled in Munich and taught at the Academy where he was appointed professor of architecture in 1820. His work as a practical architect began with this appointment. In 1822 Friedrich von Gärtner was appointed artistic director of the Nymphenburg Porcelain Manufactory. Gärtner eventually became head government surveyor of buildings and from 1842 director of the Academy of Fine Arts in Munich. Gärtner and Leo von Klenze were the most distinguished practitioners working in Munich in the first half of 19th century, and influenced later generations. Gärtner's Ludwigskirche in the Ludwigstrasse in Munich strongly influenced other church architecture, especially in North America. His son Friedrich Gärtner (1824-1905) was a noted architectural painter. "

4583,François Chauveau,1613,1676,"Etcher, draughtsman and painter, part of a French family of artists. The sons of the etcher François Chauveau (1613-1676) included three painters, Louis Chauveau (c. 1656-after 1695), Charles Chauveau (b 1658/9; fl c. 1683) and Evrard Chauveau (1660-1793) and also one sculptor, René Chauveau (1663-1722). François Chauveau's family belonged to the minor nobility; a decline in its fortunes obliged him to earn his living as an artist. Although he had been a pupil of Laurent de La Hyre, he forsook painting (except as an amateur), devoting himself wholly to printmaking; he became one of the most prolific etchers of his time, executing, in particular, a great many vignettes for books. He had an extraordinary facility in composition; his own oeuvre numbers more than 1600 prints, and he made some 1400 drawings for other printmakers. He was the 17th century's most popular illustrator of fiction and plays. In 1663 Chauveau was admitted (reçu) to the Académie Royale and made a councillor. For Louis XIV he engraved (1664-70) the Carrousel de 1662: the quality of his work earned him the title of Graveur du Roi and a pension of 600 livres. He also set out to engrave, after Eustache Le Sueur, a series of the Life of St Bruno but died before finishing the work, which was completed by Sébastien Leclerc the Elder. The inventory made after Chauveau's death mentions various paintings by him. "

40445,Jan de Bisschop,1623,1671,"Dutch draughtsman and etcher. He was a lawyer by profession and a skilled amateur draughtsman. At the Amsterdam Latin school his teacher was the humanist Hadrianus Junius (1511-75), under whose supervision he wrote a poem about the Atheneum Illustre and Collegium Auriacum in Breda, published by Johannes Blaeu in 1647. From 1648 to 1652 he read law at Leiden University. In 1653 he married Anna van Baerle, daughter of the famous professor and theologian Caspar van Baerle (1584-1648), and throughout his life he moved in prominent intellectual circles. One of his closest friends was Constantijn Huygens the younger, who was also an amateur draughtsman, with a very similar drawing style (especially in landscapes), and who was probably a member - with Jacob van der Does (1623-73) and Willem Doudijns (1630-97) - of the small drawing academy that de Bisschop founded in The Hague. Although de Bisschop lived for a while in a house adjoining Claes Moeyaert's in Amsterdam, it was probably Bartholomeus Breenbergh, also living in Amsterdam at the time, rather than Moeyaert who most influenced his style of drawing. De Bisschop made two large etchings after paintings by Breenbergh: Joseph Selling Corn to the People (1644; untraced) and the Martyrdom of St Lawrence (1647; Frankfurt am Main, Städelsches Kunstinstitut). De Bisschop's landscapes in brown ink wash imitated Breenbergh's evocations of Italianate sunlight. Despite drawing numerous Italianate landscapes, De Bisschop probably never went to Italy; other artists' works were his sources. Whether drawing with pen or brush, he used a warm golden-brown ink, later named ""bisschops-inkt"" after him. In addition to landscapes, De Bisschop made figure studies and drawings after classical sculptures and famous paintings, primarily by Italian artists. His publications, which reproduced antique sculptures and Old Master drawings, were instrumental in disseminating the classical style in Holland. He also designed title pages for books, mostly by classical authors, and published his own compositions. "

In a long and extremely productive career he painted frescoes in many of the great churches in Naples, and he became one of the wealthiest and most famous European artists of his day. His vigorous style, often marked by dramatic lighting, owed much to the example of such Baroque artists as Luca Giordano (his outstanding predecessor in Naples), Lanfranco, and Preti, but it also has a firmness of structure and a clarity of draughtmanship that shows his allegiance to the classical tradition of Raphael and Annibale Carracci. Solimena's paintings were in demand all over Europe, and his international influence was spread also by his celebrity as teacher. Ramsay was among his pupils and Fragonard copied his work in San Paolo Maggiore. "

34641,Ridolfo Ghirlandaio,1483,1561,"Italian painter, son of Domenico Ghirlandaio. He probably learnt his craft from his father and remained with his uncle Davide Ghirlandaio when the latter took over the workshop in 1494. Ridolfo’s first documented work is the Virgin of the Sacred Girdle (1509; Prato Cathedral), which was commissioned in 1507 from Davide and Ridolfo but probably mostly painted by the latter. The upper part still shows Domenico’s influence, whereas the lower section reflects, somewhat clumsily, the more modern style of Fra Bartolommeo, with whom Ridolfo studied, according to Vasari. An interest in Piero di Cosimo is also apparent in the use of light and the sometimes disquieting landscapes of the earlier works that may be attributed to Ridolfo with certainty. This is particularly evident in SS Peter and Paul (Florence, Pitti), commissioned from Davide in 1503 but attributable to Ridolfo on the basis of style, the Virgin and Child between SS Francis and Mary Magdalene (1503; Florence, Accademia) and the Coronation of the Virgin (1504; Paris, Louvre), which was inspired by Domenico’s altarpiece of the same subject (1484–86; Narni, Pinacoteca Comunale). Another very interesting work that may be dated to the first decade of the 16th century is the Procession to Calvary (London, National Gallery), which shows signs of Ridolfo’s study of Leonardo’s lost cartoon of the Battle of Anghiari.

His first great popular successes were the bronze David and Gloria Victis, which was shown and received the Medal of Honour of the Paris Salon. The bronze was subsequently placed in the Square Montholon. Mercié was appointed Professor of Drawing and Sculpture at the École des Beaux Arts, and was elected a member of the Académie Française in 1891, after being awarded the biennial prize of the Institute of 800 in 1887. He was subsequently elected to grand officier of the Légion d'Honneur, and in 1913 became the president of the Société des Artistes Français. Tombstones, busts, architectural models, and statues of horses and riders for clients all over the world completed the oeuvre of this artist. "

He specialized in landscapes depicting Dutch cities and historic monuments. Fantastic scenes and a few portrait studies also belong to his oeuvre. Rademaker's reputation is associated most frequently with his publications of topographical views of the northern Netherlands, the Rhine and Cleves. For his first, and most famous, comprehensive and historically informative publication, Rademaker etched many of his 300 images after well-known 17th-century drawings and prints. Subsequently, he based his prints on his own drawings. Where monuments have been destroyed and ruins restored beyond recognition, Rademaker's publications provide an invaluable record of Holland in the 17th century and the early 18th. In systematically compiling directories of identifiable places, he codified the inclination to record the local Dutch landscape. "

Certainly his prints achieve their pictorial effect better than those of the Germans. They are often based on designs by Raphael and Parmigianino. "
10467,Hector Guimard,1867,1942,"French architect, furniture designer, and writer. He studied decorative arts and architecture in Paris, where he later established his own practice. The influence of Eugène-Emmanuel Viollet-le-Duc is evident in his early works, which culminated in the Castel Béranger block of flats, Paris, where his first use of the Art Nouveau style appeared in its decorative elements. In 1895, after visiting the first Art Nouveau building, Victor Horta's Hotel Tassel in Brussels, Guimard proceeded to a complete re-evaluation of his artistic approach; furniture and interior decoration of a house had to become parts of a total work of art. After seeing Horta's work, Guimard made changes to the original neo-Gothic decorative elements of the Castel Béranger, introducing a colourful mixture of facing materials and organically derived embellishments, based on his belief that decoration is the more effective for being non-representational. Between 1899 and 1914, Guimard's style matured to a full-blooded Art Nouveau, although he also continued his picturesque manner in suburban villas, He entered the competition to design Paris Métro stations in 1896, failing to win but getting the job because the railway company's president was attracted to the Art Nouveau style. He designed and created the station entrances of Paris subway ""Le Métropolitain"" from 1898 to 1905; they were an expression of Art Nouveau, discovered during the 1900 World Exposition in Paris. The stations, which were modular and conceived for mass production, were in production until 1913. Together with the Humbert de Romans auditorium (1897-1901; destroyed 1905), an enormous concert hall and chapel with elaborate decorations and fittings, they represented the most complete architectural expression of Art Nouveau in France. The architectural and decorative works of Hector Guimard are characterized by fluid, unusual lines, vibrant curves inspired by nature, essential shapes underlined by light and contrast of the different materials used, such as wood, iron and stone. They are the most representative of the organic and floral Art Nouveau Style in France, and his style would later be known as the ""Guimard Style"". "

He grew up in France and moved to England in 1879, where he started an apprenticeship with a wood engraver and cutter in London. There he met William Morris and joined the Pre-Raphaelite circle. From 1889 to 1897 Ricketts and Charles Shannon (1863-1937) published the Art Nouveau periodical The Dial. In 1896 the two friends set up the Vale Press, a printing works that specialized in luxury book editions for which Ricketts did many of the illustrations. He also worked for the magazine The Hobby Horse and in 1922 became a member of the Royal Academy. In his graphics, Ricketts developed his own style, with generous curved lines akin to French Art Nouveau, although one can also clearly detect the influence of Aubry Vincent Beardsley. Ricketts was also successful with his stage sets and metalwork. "

34303,Pierre Drevet,1663,1738,"French engraver, part of a family of engravers. The family gave the leading portrait engravers of France for over a hundred years. Their fame began with Pierre (called Pierre the Elder), and was sustained by his son, Pierre-Imbert (called Pierre the Younger, 1697-1739), and by his nephew, Claude (1705-1782). Pierre Drevet was born at Loire in the Lyonnais, the son of Estienne Drevet, and began his studies with Germain Audran in Lyons, continuing them with Gérard Audran in Paris. His progress was rapid, and in 1696 he was made court engraver. In 1707 he was admitted to membership in the Académie des Beaux-Arts, his reception picture being an engraving of Robert de Cotte. Hyacinthe Rigaud's portraits were in high favour at the end of the seventeenth century and Drevet was the first to encounter the difficulties of translating into black and white the natural appearance of texture and materials in the latter's oil paintings. Always engraving after oil-paintings, Drevet was at times uneven, but this was arguably because the originals were uneven. His engravings were mainly the portraits of distinguished people. Among his many plates are a portrait of Jean-Baptiste Colbert (1700); portraits of Louis XIV and Louis XV, both after Rigaud; a Crucifixion, after Coypel, and a portrait of Charles II of England. During the last years of his life Drevet worked with his son and they produced plates together. He died in Paris. "

In the summer of 1888 he travelled to Pont-Aven and joined the small group of artists centred there around Paul Gauguin, whose style he adhered to, particularly in his paintings of Breton landscapes. With Maurice Denis, Sérusier was a founder and spokesman of the Nabis. Sérusier had a highly methodical approach to art; he expressed his theories in ""ABC de la peinture"" (1921). "

23079,Martin Schaffner,1477,1549,"German painter and medallist. He produced some of the outstanding altarpieces of the Renaissance in Swabia. His birthdate is suggested by a self-portrait medal of 1522 (Munich, Staatliche Münzsammlung) on which he describes himself as aged 44. He was obviously trained in Jörg Stocker's workshop in Ulm: his name first appears on the reverse side of the winged altar made by Stocker in 1496 for St Martin at Ennetach (Sigmaringen Castle), where he signed the Carrying of the Cross. Yet Schaffner's contribution here would have been confined to subsidiary details; Stocker, a rather conservative and spiritless artist, could have imparted only basic painting skills to the young painter. An altar wing with paintings on both sides (1500; Ulm, Museum), perhaps also painted by Schaffner in Stocker's studio, seems old-fashioned, though not totally devoid of the charm of his later figures. Schaffner was a taxpaying householder in Ulm in 1499, suggesting that he had meanwhile become an independent master, free to develop along his own lines. From 1510 his paintings show plastic forms, light colours and effective light and shade tones. After 1526 he was a city painter in Ulm, and in the last 30 years of his life he was the only significant representative of the Ulm painting school. "
40557,Gustave Doré,1832,1883,"French illustrator, painter and sculptor, best known for his illustrations of epic literature, such as those by Dante, Cervantes, Hugo, and Milton, as well as contemporary texts, such as those by Balzac. In 1847 he went to Paris and began producing lithographic caricatures for a weekly journal and several albums of lithographs (1847-54). He achieved fame and wide popularity with his wood-engraved book illustrations; among the finest were editions of Dante's Inferno (1861) and the Bible (1866). His vivid work is characterized by images of the grotesque and bizarre. Employing over 40 block cutters, he eventually produced more than 90 illustrated books. Dramatic, chiaroscuro illustrations of the Bible and literary giants made Doré's name. He had a particular gift for illustrating nature and fairy tales. An enthusiastic traveler, in his later career he spent much time in England, where he illustrated Tennyson and others, and opened his own successful Doré Gallery. In 1872, he began to record the conditions of London slums. These engravings are rich in dramatic detail and show a harsh and nightmarish world.Among his numerous projects, The Rime of the Ancient Mariner, published in England 1875, dates to his later, darker years. He considered it one of his ""best and most original"" works. The book was a great commercial success, even in the United States. His work influenced that of Van Gogh and later, the Symbolists. He died at age fifty-one of a heart attack. "

42090,Vincenzo Campi,1536,1591," The Campi were a family of Italian painters in Cremona in the 16th century. In the north of Italy, where they had the splendid example of the Venetians and some knowledge of Flemish and German art, the contrasts of light and shade could express the Mannerist feeling perfectly, as in the work of the Campi at Cremona. The head of the family was Galeazzo Campi (1477-1536), a pupil of Boccaccio Boccaccini. His close contacts with Tommaso Aleni are assumed, owing to stylistic alliance. In his landscapes influences from Giovanni Bellini and Perugino can be observed. He was the father of Giulio, Antonio and Vincenzo. Giulio Campi worked chiefly in Cremona. His first altarpieces reveal ideas from Brescia and the Emilia. He collaborated with Camillo Boccaccino, later was influenced by Giulio Romano and Pordenone. Antonio Campi (Cavaliere Antonio) was the second son of Galeazzo. His initial works remain close to the style of his brother Giulio, and that of Camillo Boccaccino. His graphic works exhibit influences from Parmigianino and Emilian sculpture. In 1560 he abandoned collaboration with his brother Giulio and began to develop more independently. He had probably contacts with Peterzano in the last decade, whose Reformist style he approached. Vincenzo Campi trained under his brother Giulio. He painted mainly saints and portraits as well as genre-like still-lifes, like the two fruit and fishmongers' paintings at the Brera, Milan. Both show that he was influenced by Pieter Aertsen. Bernardino Campi (1522-1591) was not directly related to Galeazzo Campi or his sons. Nevertheless he was an assistant to Giulio Campi and was influenced by Giulio Romano. "

He was a prolific artist: 1052 prints are described in the catalogue raisonné and thousands of his drawings are in public and private collections. He was one of the greatest Italian etchers, whose prints of battles and sieges, harbours, festivals, plays and operas are filled with tiny figures and vividly suggest many features of 17th-century urban and rural life. Della Bella's landscape etchings were an important influence on the prints of the Lorraine artists François Collignon and Israël Silvestre. His work was overlooked in the 19th century but in the 1960s and 1970s became well known through exhibitions and scholarly publications, distinguishing his work from that of Jacques Callot. "

41346,Allaert van Everdingen,1621,1675,"Dutch landscape and marine painter. He worked with Savery in Utrecht and Molyn in Haarlem. In the 1640s he visited Scandinavia, where he developed a taste for subjects inspired by the scenery there - above all mountain torrents - and helped to popularize such themes in the Netherlands. Jacob van Ruisdael, in his pictures of majestic waterfalls, was one of the artists influenced by him. Allaert was also a fine etcher. His elder brother Caesar (1617-78), who painted portraits and historical pictures, was attracted by the south not the north. Although he never went to Italy, he captured the spirit of Italian art better than many of his countrymen who crossed the Alps: witness his beautiful Four Muses with Pegasus (c.1650), part of the decoration of the royal villa - the Huis ten Bosch - at The Hague. "
17526,Louise Moillon,1610,1696,"The greatest still-life painter of the French seventeenth century. She spent her long career in Paris, specializing specifically in still-life pictures with the occasional figure. She came from a strictly Calvinist family. In 1640 she married the wealthy timber merchant Etienne Girardot de Chancourt, also a Huguenot. Her technique was extremely refined, and this led, in later centuries, to the confusion of her work with Dutch, Flemish and even German painters. Since four still-life pictures at Grenoble, once given to Moillon, have been reattributed to the Flemish artist Osias Beert, Moillon's art has been redefined. Her best pictures have a stillness combined with acute powers of observation, notably of the texture of exotic fruit, which have never been surpassed."

18903,Jan Mijtens,1609,1670,"Dutch painter, member of a family of painters of Flemish origin (spelled also Meytens; Mytens). He was nephew of Daniel Mijtens I. He was the son of Daniel's elder brother David, a saddle-maker in The Hague. Daniel Mijtens I was a portrait painter in England in the Stuart court, Martin Mijtens I was a portrait painter in Stockholm; his son Martin van Meytens II later became a portrait painter at the imperial court in Vienna. Jan may have learnt to paint from his uncle Isaac Mijtens. After 1634 he may have trained with his uncle Daniel, who had by then returned to The Hague; Jan married Daniel's daughter Anna in 1642. In 1639 he had been admitted to The Hague's guild of painters, of which he became a governor in 1656. In the latter year he helped to found the painters' society De Pictura; from 1667-8 he was a governor of this society and from 1669-70 its dean. Throughout his life Mijtens was a fashionable portrait painter in The Hague. He received commissions from prominent citizens, members of the nobility, and high-placed government officials. His portraits can be divided into two major groups: life-size three-quarter length, and half-length portraits of individuals and small-scale family groups. He conveyed his sitters' elevated status by depicting them wearing sumptuous garments and jewelry. "

27256,Francesco Vanni,1563,1610,"Painter, draughtsman and printmaker. He studied first in Siena with his stepfather Arcangelo Salimbeni, and then in Rome (1579-80) with Giovanni de' Vecchi. The stylistic sources of his earliest works, such as the Baptism of Constantine (1586-87, Siena, S Agostino), lie both in the art of Salimbeni, which represented a reaction against the artificiality of Mannerism, and in the art of the Counter-Reformation in Rome, particularly that of Federico Zuccaro. From 1585 the strongest influence on his work is the art of Federico Barocci. This is particularly evident in the sharp and acid colours, rich in clear and iridescent tones, of Christ Appearing to St Catherine (Siena, Santuario Cateriniano) and of the Baptism (1587, ex-S Giovannino e Gennaro, Siena). It is also evident in his handling of facial types in the Immaculate Conception (1588; Montalcino Cathedral) and still more marked in the Annunciation (1589; Siena, S Maria dei Servi), commissioned by the Servi Order in Siena, which is directly based on Barocci's Annunciation (Rome, Pinacoteca Vaticana). Vanni also responded to the art of the Carracci, which he may have assimilated during a probable apprenticeship with Bartolomeo Passerotti in Bologna, or while on a visit to that city. St Francis Receiving the Child from the Virgin (Florence, Uffizi) has long been attributed to Ludovico Carracci but is in fact the bozzetto for Vanni's St Anthony Receiving the Child from the Virgin (Amsterdam, Rijksmuseum). His son Raffaele Vanni (1587-1673) was also a painter. "

34929,Joseph Highmore,1692,1780,"English painter, mainly of portraits. He studied at Kneller's Academy and had a considerable practice as a portraitist by the 1720s. His early work is in the manner of Richardson, but from the 1730s his portraits became more elegant as he responded to the Rococo influences that began to pervade English painting at this time. Some of his more informal works, however, have a directness and freshness that recall Hogarth (Mr. Oldham and Friends, Tate Gallery, London). Highmore was a friend of the novelist Samuel Richardson and painted a series of twelve illustrations to 'Pamela"" (Tate Gellery; Fitzwilliam, Cambridge; National Gallery of Victoria, Melbourne), which link him with Hayman and Hogarth as one of the initiators of a British school of narrative painting. He also painted Richardson's portrait (National Portrait Gallery, London). In 1761 he gave up painting and retired to Canterbury to devote himself to literary pursuits. "

He then worked under the Bolognese Giovanni Giacomo Sementi, an uninspired imitator of Guido Reni. Sementi died in 1636, and in 1638 Brandi visited Naples. In 1646-47 he was again in Rome, employed in the workshop of Giovanni Lanfranco, who had recently returned from Naples. This is confirmed by Brandi's Joseph's Dream (Rome, Galeria Corsini), which is based on one of Lanfranco's works. In 1647 Brandi joined the Accademia dei Virtuosi al Pantheon in Rome and from 1651 was present at the meetings of the Accademia di S Luca. He executed paintings, frescoes and stuccoes for the Chiesa di S. Carlo al Corso (1673-84), paintings for Chiesa di S. Andrea al Quirinale and for other churches in Rome. "

48521,Bartolomeo Ammanati,1511,1592,"Italian Mannerist sculptor and architect, strongly influenced by Michelangelo and by Sansovino. Orphaned at the age of 12, Ammanati earnt his living in the 'Academy' of Baccio Bandinelli c. 1523–27, after which time he left Florence for Venice. Jacopo Sansovino had just arrived there after the Sack of Rome (1527), and Ammanati was probably involved on some of Sansovino's early commissions. He left Venice after about five years, worked in Pisa, then returned to Florence where he carved a statue of Leda. From 1536 to 1538 Ammanati worked with Giovanni Angelo Montorsoli on the tomb of the poet Jacopo Sannazaro for Santa Maria del Parto, Naples, carving statues of Apollo/David, Minerva/Judith, St Nazarius and two putti below. In Venice, Ammanati collaborated on Sansovino's Biblioteca Marciana carving several river gods on the spandrels and some lion-masks on the keystones of the arches on the façade. Ammanati was documented as active in Padua and Vicenza intermittently between 1544 and 1548. He carved a colossal Hercules for the courtyard of the Paduan palazzo of the humanist jurist and antiquarian Marco Mantova Benavides (in situ). This was followed by a triumphal arch in the garden of the palazzo, with statues of Jupiter and Apollo (finished 1547; in situ), and by the tomb of Marco Mantova Benavides (unveiled 1546) in the church of the Eremitani, Padua. In Urbino on 17 April 1550 Ammanati married the poetess Laura Battiferri (1523–89), later the subject of an extraordinary portrait by Agnolo Bronzino. They travelled to Rome to solicit work from the newly elected pope, Julius III. This resulted in a commission for a pair of tombs, for the Pope's uncle, Cardinal Antonio Maria Ciocchi del Monte, and for Fabiano del Monte (finished c. 1553) in San Pietro in Montorio. When Julius III died in 1555, Ammanati was summoned by Vasari back to Florence to enter the service of Duke Cosimo I de' Medici. He shortly received a major commission for the spectacular Fountain of Juno for the Sala Grande of the Palazzo Vecchio. The fountain was never erected in the hall but was set up out of doors at Pratolino. The six over life-size marble fountain figures are now in the Bargello, Florence. In 1559–60 Ammanati successfully cast in bronze the great terminal group of Hercules and Antaeus for Niccolò Tribolo's Fountain of Hercules on the lowest terrace of the gardens behind Cosimo's villa of Il Castello; this technical feat had previously defeated Vincenzo Danti on account of the complexity of the composition. Between 1563 and 1565 Ammanati also modelled a half-length giant in stone to represent the mountain range of the Apennines. It is the centrepiece of the fishpond on the highest terrace of the gardens of Il Castello. Ammanati's best-known sculpture is the Fountain of Neptune (c. 1560–75) in the Piazza della Signoria, Florence. The central figure was carved out of a colossal block of marble that had been begun by Bandinelli before his death (1560), and this inhibited Ammanati's treatment. Consequently (by general consent) the Neptune is neither characteristic nor aesthetically satisfactory. More successful are the surrounding bronze figures of four recumbent deities and a troop of gesticulating fauns and satyrs (all 1571–75), modelled and cast under his supervision by a team of assistants. The general design and character of these figures, as well as an allegorical female nude statuette personifying Ops (1572–73) epitomize Ammanati's mature style. In 1572 Ammanati was commissioned by Pope Gregory XIII to create a tomb for his nephew, Giovanni Buoncompagni, which was erected in the Camposanto of Pisa. It consists of an aedicula framing a central statue of the Risen Christ, draped and showing his wounds. By 1582 Ammanati had become so strongly influenced by the Counter-Reformation and the Jesuits, that in a famous letter to the Accademia del Disegno in Florence he denounced on moral grounds the public display of nude sculpture. As well as being a sculptor, Ammanati was also a gifted architect, generally following the lead of Michelangelo's designs for the Biblioteca Laurenziana and for the New Sacristy in San Lorenzo, both in Florence. Ammanati's tombs and major fountains had involved him in this field from early in his career, and in the 1540s he had worked on Sansovino's Biblioteca Marciana in Venice and on the Benavides triumphal arch in Padua. In the following decade, in Rome, he began more specifically architectural work for Pope Julius III, in the sunken courtyard and fountain grottoes of the Villa Giulia, alongside Giacomo da Vignola and Vasari (1552). In Florence after 1555, in addition to the various elaborate fountains that Cosimo I ordered, he was also commissioned to improve (1560–77) the Palazzo Pitti, which had been acquired (1549) as a residence for the Duchess, Eleonora of Toledo. His masterpiece there is the half-sunken courtyard, with the surrounding building rising a full three storeys on three sides of a rectangle, and, above a fountain grotto on the fourth side, framing a view over the Boboli Gardens, which were being laid out axially up the steep hill that rises towards the Belvedere fortress. Ammanati designed palazzi in Florence which are characterized by a continual and inventive variety of forms. In 1558 the Ponte di Santa Trinita was destroyed when the River Arno flooded. After an unsuccessful initial approach to Michelangelo in Rome, Ammanati received the commission for its reconstruction to a new design (1567–70). In Lucca, Ammanati was commissioned to reconstruct the Palazzo Ducale (1577–81); he finished the minor façade but left incomplete the Cortile degli Svizzeri and the great courtyard. Ammanati was in contact with the Jesuit Order from 1572, when they were proposing to enlarge their college in Florence and to reconstruct the neighbouring church of San Giovannino (1579–85). In their wills Ammanati and his wife left all their property to the Jesuits in Florence, as they had no children. By 1584 he had started to prepare an elaborate treatise on architecture and town planning (untraced). A collection of plans of building types, known as La città, is in the Uffizi, some drawings are also in the Uffizi and in the Biblioteca Riccardiana, and papers left to the Jesuits are in the Biblioteca Nazionale Centrale, all in Florence.

Back in England, he became with Flaxman the leader of the Neoclassical movement in sculpture. He developed a particular interest in ancient sarcophagi, and his relief of the Death of Germanicus of 1774 (Earl of Leicester, Holkman Hall, Norfolk) was probably among the first sculptures produced by an English sculptor in a Neoclassical mode. He had a very high reputation with his contemporaries: Reynolds called him 'the first British sculptor who has produced works of classic grace' and Queen Charlotte (queen consort of George III) is said to have wept when she saw his most famous work, the monument to Penelope, Boothby (Ashbourne Church, Derbyshire, 1793), in which the child is shown sleeping rather than dead. Small monuments such as this show Banks at his best, and his few surviving portrait busts demonstrate a gift for characterization. His larger monuments, however, are somewhat ponderous. "

He became a master in the Antwerp Guild of St Luke in 1503. In 1507-8 Jan was paid for painting angels and restoring the Holy Ghost in Antwerp Cathedral. He and Joos van Cleve became joint deans of the guild in 1520. His work was influenced by painter Cornelis Engebrechtsz of Leiden and his Antwerp contemporaries. Wellens de Cock was - along with his fellow townsman Joos van Cleve - one of the few painters in the north interested in landscape in the early sixteenth century. Later, this interest was to spread to broader circles. Wellens de Cock was the father of landscape painter Matthijs Cock and Hieronymus Cock, who acquired fame as one of the first professional print publishers in northern Europe. His widow, Clara von Beeringen, was mentioned on 19 January 1527 as the wife of the landscape painter Frans Vermeer. "

He was a younger contemporary of Reynolds, with whom he is often compared but Graff really belongs to a later generation, since most of his portraits lack the trappings of the Grand Style, and he worked almost into the Biedermeier period. He was in Augsburg by 1756 and removed to Dresden in 1766 to teach at the newly founded Academy. He recorded himself as having painted some 1,240 portraits in his long career and his sitters included many of the most famous of his contemporaries - Lessing, Herder, Schiller (whom he records as having fidgeted the whole time). He also made some 322 portrait drawings in silver point, a very rare technique in the 18th century. Some fragments of an autobiography were posthumously published in Zurich in 1815. There are pictures in many German museums, including Berlin, Dresden, Leipzig. "

Apart from a few portraits, he devoted himself exclusively to the painting of conversation pieces - the cheerful domestic life of prosperous burghers in their houses or gardens. He was not interested in the serious side of life; in his work he depicted people in conversation or while flirting, making music and dancing, eating and drinking. His interiors are hardly worked out, all the emphasis is put on fashionable dress and colourful representation. He succeeded in putting across people's high spirits through facial expression, costly dress, posture and loose grouping. "
34342,Jean Duvet,1485,1580,"French goldsmith and engraver. He was the son of Drouhot Duvet, a goldsmith active in Dijon at the end of the 15th century and the beginning of the 16th. He was admitted as a master goldsmith in Dijon in 1509, but most of his career was in Langres. From 1540 onwards he lived in Geneva, where he worked for the city council and might therefore have become a Protestant. His earliest dated engraving is an Annunciation of 1520 which is of pure Italian style. His Judgement of Solomon, undated but probably early, is based on Raphael's cartoon of Elymas the Sorcerer. These and other early works leads to the conclusion that he must have visited Italy and seen the works of Raphael and his contemporaries. It is in the twenty-four engravings illustrating the Apocalypse that Duvet's full imaginative power is seen. Apart from the Apocalypse the most famous engravings by Duvet are the Unicorn series, which may be dated to the 1540s. He is known to have participated in the preparation of the decorations for the entry of Francis I into Langres in 1521, and he designed and directed the decorations and floats for the entry of Francis in 1533. Nothing remains of his work as a goldsmith, but he is known to have completed a reliquary bust of St Mammes in 1524 for Langres Cathedral, to have sold a damascened basin to Francis I in 1528 when the King visited Dijon and to have made a number of other works.

40453,François Boucher,1703,1770,"French Rococo painter, engraver, and designer, who best embodies the frivolity and elegant superficiality of French court life at the middle of the 18th century. He was for a short time a pupil of François Lemoyne and in his early years was closely connected with Watteau, many of whose pictures he engraved. In 1727-31 he was in Italy, and on his return was soon busy as a versatile fashionable artist. His career was hugely successful and he received many honours, becoming Director of the Gobelins factory in 1755 and Director of the Academy and King's Painter in 1765. He was also the favourite artist of Louis XV's most famous mistress, Mme de Pompadour, to whom he gave lessons and whose portrait he painted several times (Wallace Collection, London; National Gallery, Edinburgh). Boucher mastered every branch of decorative and illustrative painting, from colossal schemes of decoration for the royal châteaux of Versailles, Fontainebleau, Marly, and Bellevue, to designs for fans and slippers. In his typical paintings he turned the traditional mythological themes into wittily indecorous scènes galantes, and he painted female flesh with a delightfully healthy sensuality, notably in the celebrated Reclining Girl (Alte Pinakothek, Munich. 1751), which probably represents Louis XV's mistress Louisa O'Murphy. Towards the end of his career, as French taste changed in the direction of Neoclassicism, Boucher was attacked, notably by Diderot, for his stereotyped colouring and artificiality; he relied on his own repertory of motifs instead of painting from the life and objected to nature on the grounds that it was 'too green and badly lit'. Certainly his work often shows the effects of superficiality and overproduction, but at its best it has irresistible charm and great brilliance of execution. qualities he passed on to his most important pupil, Fragonard.

35416,Hanns Lautensack,1519,1566,"German printmaker. Often erroneously referred to as Hans Sebald Lautensack, he was the son of Paul Lautensack (1478-1558), a painter and organist from Bamberg. In 1527, the family moved to Nuremberg where he probably studied with a goldsmith. He then began creating topographical views of the city and landscapes that were influenced by the Danube School, in particular by Albrecht Altdorfer's works. Lautensack also produced portraits of Nuremberg burghers until 1554, when Emperor Ferdinand I summoned him to reproduce his classical coin collection. In portraits of Nuremberg burghers from 1552 and 1553, Lautensack developed a trademark composition that related his sitter to the outdoors by showing a view through a window to a distant landscape. While in Vienna, Lautensack's patronage expanded from burghers to humanist and court circles, whose members he portrayed in a new, more mannered style. His landscape etchings from this period became more panoramic as he increased the middle distance and added tiny figures in the foreground. Although some documents refer to Lautensack as a painter, no paintings by him survive. "

After his parents' deaths he was brought up by his uncle, who apprenticed him to the landscape painter Gaspard de Witte (1624-81) or, according to other sources, to Huysman's half-brother Pieter, though there is nothing to support this in the records of the Antwerp Guild of St Luke. He moved to Brussels to train with Jacques d'Arthois, who, on Huysmans's own testimony, was the most important influence on his development as a painter. On 24 January 1682 he married Maria Anna Schepers in Mechelen and in 1688 signed an agreement with the Mechelen painters' guild, which allowed him, upon payment of 24 guilders and 14 stuivers, to practise his trade there. Perhaps some difficulties he experienced with the guild encouraged his move to Antwerp, where he became a master in 1706-07. In 1716 he returned to Mechelen, where he took on Augustus-Casimir Redel and Jean Edmond Turner as pupils. Most of his life was spent in Mechelen. His landscapes, painted with a broad brush, are rich in warm, dark tones; he emulated the colouring of the Venetians. His works may be seen in many important European museums. The Metropolitan Museum has two landscapes. "

40845,William Sawrey Gilpin,1762,1843,"English landscape watercolourist and garden designer, part of a family of artists, son of Sawrey Gilpin. He attended the school of his uncle, William Gilpin, at Cheam in Surrey. Gilpin married Elizabeth Paddock; they had two (or possibly three) sons, one of whom seems to have remained dependent on his father. Gilpin specialised in watercolours; and in 1804 was elected first President of the Society of Painters in Water-Colours. In 1806 he took a post as drawing master at the Royal Military College (at Sandhurst from 1812), teaching cadets to make accurate records of the landscape. In order to support his family, in 1820 Gilpin turned to a career as a landscape gardener in which he was remarkably successful building up a large practice in England. In his work he enjoyed the strong backing of Uvedale Price (1747-1829) whose theories he put into practice. As a garden designer, he is an intermediate figure, stylistically lying between the picturesque landscapes of his uncle and the full-blown Victorian rediscovery of formality. "

Christoph Stimmer I (c. 1490-1562) worked in Konstanz as a schoolmaster from 1520 to 1532, but was also a calligrapher and painter. There are glass paintings (14 panels, 1524-25) signed with his name in Pfullendorf Town Hall, and he also used contemporary prints by such artists as Hans Leu II, Niklaus Manuel and Hans Holbein the Younger as models for his compositions. In 1532 he moved to Schaffhausen, where he became a citizen and a member of the guild in 1535, and worked as a bookbinder in 1558. Of his 11 children, Tobias Stimmer was the most famous, and at least five of his other sons were also artists. Christoph Stimmer II (c. 1522-c. 1562) was a calligrapher, Abel Stimmer (1542-c. 1606) was a painter and etcher, Gideon Stimmer (1545-1577) was a painter and designer of stained glass, Hans Christoffel Stimmer (1549-c. 1578) was a pattern-cutter and Josias Stimmer (1555-after 1574) was a painter. No details are known of Tobias Stimer's apprenticeship, which he must have completed c. 1556. His early drawings (1557 and 1558) show surprising self-assurance and by the early 1560s were of extremely high quality, as is shown by Christ on the Cross (1561; London, British Museum), Crucifixion (1562; New York, Pierpont Morgan Library) and Squirrel Eating a Nut (c. 1563; Zurich, Kunsthaus;), a brush drawing with white highlights in watercolour and bodycolour, notable for its naturalistic style and reminiscent of Albrecht Dürer's studies of nature. His Self-portrait (c. 1563; Donaueschingen, Fürstenberg Sammlungen), a pen and watercolour drawing in brown over a preparatory drawing in chalk, is a striking departure from the norm of self-portrayal: his head is bent down so that his right eye is completely obscured by his nose, a position that could hardly have been seen by looking in the mirror. In a second Self-portrait (1569; Darmstadt, Hessisches Landesmuseum) a pen drawing with white highlights, Stimmer posed with his head imperiously raised. He also produced a group of drawings for bannerets, for example Banneret of Berne (c. 1569; Zurich, Kunsthaus), a pen drawing with white highlights on a red ground. "

Ventura possibly spent some time in northern Italy before going to Rome, where he worked from 1588, collaborating on the fresco decoration of the Biblioteca Apostolica Vaticana (the Vatican Library) during the reign of Pope Sixtus V (reg 1585-90). Salimbeni's painting during 1590-91, when he worked in Il Gesu and S Maria Maggiore, Rome, reflects the influence of the Cavaliere d'Arpino, Cherubino Alberti and Andrea Lilli. The few engravings that Salimbeni executed were made in Rome. Of these, seven survive, dated between 1589 and 1594. In 1595 he returned to Siena where he became one of the last leaders of the Mannerist school, and completed painting cycles for Sienese churches such as Santa Trinità and Santo Spirito. He continued to create paintings for churches throughout Italy, including Assisi and Florence. For almost all of his painting cycles he first created detailed prepatory drawings. "

All that is known about his early life is that he was born in Bologna, from the accounts at Fontainebleau and one inscription on a print (see illustration). He is recorded as a painter of the First School of Fontainebleau from 1537 into the 1540s, apparently a principal assistant to Francesco Primaticcio, who had taken charge of the ""school"" decorating the Palace of Fontainebleau after the suicide in 1540 of Rosso Fiorentino. He became a leading member of the printmaking workshop at Fontainebleau and nearly 100 etchings survive, 16 dated between 1542 and 1545. Most copy designs by Rosso (about 25), Giulio Romano (21 at least), or Primaticcio. He is last recorded at Fontainebleau in 1550. In the past, art historians often confused him with Antonio da Trento, another north Italian at Fontainebleau, but the two identities have now been securely disentangled. Antonio da Trento specialized in chiaroscuro woodcuts, a technique also used by Fantuzzi, and used to be assigned Fantuzzi's prints, partly because their monograms are similar. "
10021,John Watson Gordon,1788,1864,"Scottish painter (born John Watson). He initially trained for the army and subsequently studied with David Wilkie under John Graham (1754-1817) at the Trustees' Academy in Edinburgh. He also learnt painting from his uncle, George Watson (1767-1837), and from Henry Raeburn, a close family friend, some of whose works he copied. Early pictures depicted historical and religious subjects, but he later turned to portraiture, becoming, after Raeburn's death in 1823, the leading Edinburgh portrait painter. From 1826 he called himself Watson Gordon to distinguish himself from three other Edinburgh artists called Watson. He executed numerous versions of his portrait of Sir Walter Scott, of which the original unfinished study, made in 1830, is in the National Gallery of Scotland, and painted most of the Scottish celebrities of his time. Indeed many distinguished Englishmen visited Edinburgh to be portrayed by his hand. His productions are full of character, reserve, and dignity, excellent as likenesses, and especially successful when they portray faces distinguished by intellect or by Scotch shrewdness. He was one of the artists who were admitted members of the Scottish Academy in 1829, and he was represented in the exhibitions of that body from 1830 to 1865. In 1850 he was elected as President of the Academy, and shortly afterwards he was knighted. In 1851 he was elected a Royal Academician. and he exhibited in the Royal Academy from 1827 till his death.

He specialized in the production of bronze statuettes, many of which were reproductions either of antique statues or of Giambologna's original designs, but he also produced work on his own account. He appears to have been active in Giambologna's Borgo Pinti workshop by 1580, where he remained until 1600, at which point he set up his own studio in the Via de' Pilastri. Giambologna gave Antonio a considerable number of his own working models, and the latter continued to cast statuettes from these long after Giambologna's death, which has complicated the attributional problems associated with the production of Giambologna's workshop.

His engravings of Italian master paintings became a source for Karel van Mander. He travelled to Rome in 1590 where he made his engravings of Titian, Giulio Romano and Jacopo Bassano. In Rome he might have met his compatriot Jan Brueghel the Elder with whom he later collaborated. He travelled back home and in 1599 he joined the Guild of Saint Luke in Antwerp. He made engravings after Bartholomaus Spranger, Sebastiaen Vrancx, Otto van Veen, Anthony van Dyck and Peter Paul Rubens. In 1631 he travelled to Paris. He was the teacher of his son Pieter de Jode II and Nicolaes Rijckmans (born c. 1595). "

40428,Jacopo Bassano,1505,1592,"Italian painter, the most celebrated member of a family of artists who took their name from the small town of Bassano, about 65 km from Venice (original name: Jacopo da Ponte). Apart from a period in the 1530s when he trained with Bonifazio Veronese in Venice, Jacopo worked in Bassano all his life. His father, Francesco the Elder (c. 1475-1539), was a village painter and Jacopo always retained something of the peasant artist, even though the influence of, for example, the fashionable etchings of Parmigianino is evident in his work. Even though most of his career was spent in small or middle-sized towns on the mainland, he always remained alert to the latest developments in art and won some renown in Venice itself. He also had the ability to devise new ideas for compositions that possessed great force of expression. Trained in his father's studio, Jacopo broke away from the local popular and devotional tradition by studying prints by Raphael and developments in Mannerism. During the 1540s his painting was experimental, the anatomy of his characters was forced and their postures unnatural. This phase proved crucial in the development of his own very personal style which was capable of assimilating new ideas and translating them into an art with enormous communicative power. Jacopo Bassano's popular realism was underpinned by his exceptional use of light and characterized by the lifelike quality of the people and details, especially the animals, in his pictures. Over the years his oeuvre became increasingly grand and dramatic, starting with a series of altarpieces (in Bassano, Treviso, Padua, and Belluno) whose production dates from the 1550s through to the end of his career. He treated biblical themes in the manner of rustic genre scenes, using genuine country types and portraying animals with real interest. In this way he helped to develop the taste for paintings in which the genre or still-life element assumes greater importance than the ostensible religious subject. From around 1560 his work became vested with a more exaggerated search for novel effects of light, taking on something of the iridescent coloring of Tintoretto. Bassano had four painter sons who continued his style - Francesco the Younger (1549-92), Gerolamo (1566-1621), Giovanni Battista (1553-1613), and Leandro (1557-1622). Francesco (who committed suicide by throwing himself out of a window) and Leandro both acquired some distinction and popularity working in Venice. His four painter sons increasingly contributed to his output, carrying on his studio after his death. The work of the family is well represented in the Museo Civico at Bassano. "

In the following year he drew cartoons for Grand Duke Cosimo de' Medici's tapestry works and became a member of the Accademia del Disegno. His first principal was Hans Fugger who ordered the decoration of the Fugger mansion in Venice. From 1573 onwards Sustris worked for William V, Duke of Bavaria in Landshut before he became chief architect to the Bavarian court with William's accession to the throne in 1579. "

33690,Rosa Bonheur,1822,1899,"French painter and sculptor, best known for her paintings of animals. She received her training from her father, Raymond Bonheur (1796-1849), an artist and ardent Saint-Simonian who encouraged her artistic career and independence. Precocious and talented, she began making copies in the Louvre at the age of 14 and first exhibited at the Salon in 1841. Her sympathetic portrayal of animals was influenced by prevailing trends in natural history and her deep affinity for animals, especially horses. Bonheur's art, as part of the Realist current that emerged in the 1840s, was grounded in direct observation of nature and meticulous draughtsmanship. She kept a small menagerie, frequented slaughterhouses and dissected animals to gain anatomical knowledge. Although painting was her primary medium, she also sculpted, or modelled, studies of animals, several of which were exhibited at the Salons, including a bronze Study for a Bull (1843) and Sheep (bronze; San Francisco, de Young Memorial Museum.). In 1845 she attracted favourable notice at the Salon from Théophile Thoré. In 1848 she received a lucrative commission from the State for Ploughing in the Nivernais (1849; Paris, Musée d'Orsay), which, when exhibited the next year, brought her further critical and popular acclaim. Typical of the Realist interest in rural society manifested in the contemporary works of Gustave Courbet and Jean-François Millet, Ploughing was inspired by George Sand's rustic novel La Mare au diable (1846). She exhibited regularly at the Salon until 1855. In 1865 Bonheur was awarded the Grand Cross of the Légion d'Honneur, the first woman so honoured. An early Bohemian and feminist, Bonheur defied female convention of the day by dressing in pants and smoking cigarettes. "

40869,Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec,1864,1901,"French painter and lithographer. He was the son of a wealthy nobleman, a direct descendant of the counts of Toulouse. His eccentric father lived in provincial luxury, hunting with falcons and collecting exotic weapons. Toulouse-Lautrec fell and broke both legs when he was a child. His legs did not heal properly; his torso developed normally, but his legs were permanently deformed. His stunted growth has traditionally been seen as the result of this accident, but more recently doctors have theorized that it may have been the result of a rare genetic abnormality. He showed an early gift for drawing. Encouraged by his first teachers, the animal painters René Princeteau and John Lewis Brown, Toulouse-Lautrec decided in 1882 to devote himself to painting, and that year he left for Paris, where he studied with Bonnat and Cormon and set up a studio of his own when he was 21. He settled in Montmartre, where he stayed from then on. Toulouse-Lautrec habitually stayed out most of the night, frequenting the many entertainment spots about Montmartre, especially the Moulin Rouge cabaret, and he drank a great deal. His loose living caught up with him: he suffered a breakdown in 1899, and his mother had him committed to an asylum at Neuilly. He recovered and set to work again. He died on Sept. 9, 1901, at the family estate at Malromé. As a youth he was attracted by sporting subjects and admired and was influenced by the work of Degas. He admired and was influenced by Japanese prints. His own work is, above all, graphic in nature, the paint never obscuring the strong, original draftsmanship. He detailed the music halls, circuses, brothels, and cabaret life of Paris with a remarkable objectivity born, perhaps, of his own isolation. As an observer and recorder of aspects of working-class women's life and work (washerwomen, prostitutes, dancers, singers) he ranks with Daumier, Degas, and Manet. His garish and artificial colours, the orange hair and electric green light of his striking posters, caught the atmosphere of the life they advertised. Toulouse-Lautrec's technical innovations in colour lithography created a greater freedom and a new immediacy in poster design. His posters of the dancers and personalities at the Moulin Rouge cabaret are world renowned and have inspired countless imitations. After a life of enormous productivity (more than 1,000 paintings, 5,000 drawings, and 350 prints and posters), debauchery, and alcoholism, Toulouse-Lautrec suffered a mental and physical collapse and died at the age of 37. His life has inspired numerous biographies, of varying accuracy. Although exhibitions of his work were not well received in his lifetime, he is now one of the world's most popular artists and is represented in most of the major museums of France and the United States. Many of his sketches and some paintings are in the Musée Toulouse-Lautrec of his native Albi. Recent criticism has detached his shrewd professional drive from the trappings of legend around his Parisian life. While he belonged to no theoretical school, he is sometimes classified as Post-Impressionist. His greatest contemporary impact was his series of 30 posters (1891-1901), which transformed the aesthetics of poster art. "

44129,Antonio Vivarini,1410,1484," Italian painter, part of a family of painters. Antonio seldom worked independently. He collaborated first with his brother-in-law, Giovanni d'Alemagna, and secondly with his own younger brother, Bartolomeo. Because of the collective nature of much Vivarini workshop activity, connoisseurs have remained unusually confused about Antonio's work, and attributions, particularly as regards his late work, are often misleading. Their pictures usually took the form of large-scale polyptychs with stiff, archaic-looking figures and very elaborate carved and gilded frames in the Gothic tradition. After Giovanni d'Alemagna's death in 1450, Antonio probably continued to produce independent works; from c. 1460 he ran the workshop alone. "

52507,Camille Claudel,1864,1943,"French sculptor, the elder sister of writer Paul Claudel. Her early interest in sculpture with symbolic meanings was fostered by artist Alfred Boucher. In 1881, she moved from Nogent-sur-Seine to Paris, and it was most probably in 1882 that she met and became a student of sculptor Auguste Rodin. Their relationship, which evolved into a tempestuous affair lasting until 1898, was initially one of artistic encouragement and development, but later it proved to undermine her artistic identity and contribute to her intense persecution mania for which she was later hospitalised. She adopted the master's craggy modeling style and themes of desire, secrecy, and decay as found in Rodin's The Gates of Hell. As a draftsman, she executed many portrait heads in a Social Realist style. By 1914 she was interned to a home in Montdevergues where she remained until her death in 1943. "

He entered the Jesuit order at an early age, and his artistic activity is also related to the order's enormous artistic enterprises. His masterpiece, the decoration of Rome's Jesuit churches Il Gesu and Sant'Ignazio, determined for several generations the style of internal decoration of Late Baroque churches in almost all Europe. His fresco in Sant'Ignazio, with its perspective, space-enlarging illusory architecture and with the apparition of the heavenly assembly whirling above, offered an example which was copied in several Italian, Austrian and German churches of the Jesuit order. Pozzo even published his artistic ideas in a noted theoretical work entitled Perspectiva pictorum et architectorum (1693, 1698) illustrated with engravings. On the invitation of Emperor Leopold I, in 1704 be moved to Vienna, where he worked for the sovereign, the court, Prince Johann Adam von Liechtenstein, various religious orders and churches. Some of his tasks were of a decorative, occasional character (church and theatre scenery), and these were soon destroyed. His most significant surviving work in Vienna is the monumental ceiling fresco of Liechtenstein Palace. The Triumph of Hercules, which, according to the sources, was very admired by contemporaries. Some of his Viennese altarpieces have also survived (Vienna's Jesuit church. His compositions of altarpieces and illusory ceiling frescoes had many followers in Hungary, Bohemia, Moravia, and even in Poland. "

7721,Émile Gallé,1846,1904,"French designer and craftsman, a pioneer in technical innovations in glass. He was a leading initiator of the Art Nouveau style in French glass art. The son of a successful faience and furniture producer, Gallé studied philosophy, botany, and drawing, later learning glassmaking at Meisenthal. After the Franco-German War (1870-71), he went to work in his father's factory at Nancy. He first made clear glass, lightly tinted and decorated with enamel and engraving, and soon developed the use of deeply coloured, almost opaque glasses in heavy masses, often layered in several thicknesses and carved or etched to form plant motifs. His glass was a great success at the Paris Exhibition of 1878, and he became known as a spirited designer working in contemporary revival styles.
 
Gallé's strikingly original work made a great impression when at the Paris Exposition of 1889. Over the next decade, his glass, reflecting the prevailing interest in Japanese art, became internationally known and imitated. It contributed largely to the free, asymmetric naturalism and symbolistic overtones of Art Nouveau. He employed wheel cutting, acid etching, casing (i.e., layers of various glass), and special effects such as metallic foils and air bubbles, calling his experiments marqueterie de verre (marquetry of glass). At Nancy, Gallé led the revival of craftsmanship and the dissemination of crafted glass by mass production. His workshop employed nearly 300 associates by the late 19th century. He attracted numerous artisans, including the Art Nouveau glassmaker Eugène Rousseau (1827-1891). After Gallé's death, his glass enterprise continued production until 1913. With Gallé as its creative force, a form of naturalism, predominantly floristic, was developed, later identified with The School at Nancy, established in 1901. His study of botany was the source for his natural designs, which represented leaves, ethereal flowers, vines, and fruits. His furniture designs, based on the Rococo period, continued the French tradition. He emphasized constructive points organically (e.g., corners of armoires finished in the shape of stalks or tree branches) and employed inlay and carving that were essentially floral in style. Perhaps his most characteristic concept was his meubles parlants (talking furniture), which incorporated in its decoration inlaid quotations from leading contemporary Symbolist authors such as Maurice Maeterlinck and Paul Verlaine. Both his glass and furniture were signed, sometimes most imaginatively. He collaborated with many colleagues, most notably the Art Nouveau furniture designer Louis Majorelle. "

30511,Edouard Béliard,,,"French painter, son of a Paris architect. He began his career as a lawyer's assistant and secretary. He studied first with Ernest Hébert (1817-1908) and Léon Cogniet (1794-1880). He was influenced by Corot. He exhibited in 1867 at the Salon. In 1870 he moved to London from where he returned to France in 1872 and lived in Étampes. He was a successful participant at the first and second Impressionist exhibitions. He mainly painted landscapes, and later distanced himself from Impressionist principles. He spent his last years in Étampes. "

16073,Rutilio Manetti,1571,1639,"Italian painter. He was a student of the Late Mannerist artists Francesco Vanni and Ventura Salimbeni. His earliest paintings, and especially his frescoes illustrating the Story of St Catherine and Pope Gregory (1597; Siena, Palazzo Pubblico) and his altarpiece of the Baptism (1599-1600; Siena, S Giovannino in Pantaneto), are strongly influenced by their works and also those of Federico Barocci. Although his style changed considerably during his career, Manetti never fully abandoned the fleshy, oval facial types with delicate, sweet features and the cluttered compositions that typify Sienese Mannerism. From 1600 to 1610 his paintings, for example the fresco cycle of the Story of St Roch (1605 to 1610; Siena, S Rocco alla Lupa), drew on the clear narrative style, naturalistic light effects and particularized figure types of Florentine painters such as Bernardino Poccetti and Domenico Passignano. His trip to Rome in 1615 brought him into contact with the paintings of Caravaggio and Guercino, amongst others, and his paintings take on a much stronger, more naturalistic, and altogether more ""caravaggesque"" feel after this date.

42141,Louis Gauffier,1761,1801,"French painter. Following his move to Paris, where he became a pupil of Hugues Taraval (1729-1785) and a student at the Académie Royale, in 1784 Gauffier shared the Prix de Rome with Jean-Germain Drouais and Antoine-Denis Chaudet (for sculpture), his own work being Christ and the Woman of Canaan (École Nationale Supérieure des Beaux-Arts, Paris). During his time in Rome (1785-89) Gauffier worked hard, but his health was poor and the results variable. On his return to Paris he was accepted (agréé) by the Académie as a history painter. Soon after, he returned to Rome in order to escape the worsening situation in Revolutionary Paris, although he continued to send his Neo-classical works to the Salon. In March 1790 he married Pauline Chatillon (d July 1801), a portrait painter whom he and Drouais had taught. After the execution of Louis XVI, Gauffier painted a wide breadth of history subjects, a practice central to Neo-classicism which he embraced readily. The artist's masterful composition Cleopatra and Octavian (1788, National Gallery of Scotland) is a scene taken from Plutarch's Life of Marc Anthony, Gauffier's Pygmalion, from myth. The artist not only embraced classicised story-telling, but Neo-classicism's other tenets as well. Colours were bright and primary; he employed a strong Poussinesque palette in contrast to the more sombre tones of his contemporaries. Distinct architectural elements litter his works and Gauffier's landscapes were adept topographical views of the Tuscan campagna. Gauffier never returned to France (after a brief trip in 1789); he remained in Rome from 1784 until French citizens were forced to leave the capital in 1793. Though not on the formal list of émigrés, the artist, initially excited by the new freedom to exhibit at the Salon the revolution provided, was forced to move his wife and young family to Florence after being branded a royalist. However it was not Gauffier's early death age thirty-eight that makes history painting by the artist rare: the artist was forced in Florence to turn to portraiture and landscape painting in order to earn a living. Though adept at both the later genres, Gauffier's potentially extraordinary and long career as a history painter was cut short by the storm of contemporary events. "

41278,Henry Singleton,1766,1839,"English painter and illustrator. His father died when he was young, and he was brought up by his uncle, the miniature painter William Singleton (d 1793). In 1782 he entered the Royal Academy Schools in London and in 1784 won a silver medal for a drawing from life, exhibiting at the Royal Academy for the first time the same year. He showed considerable promise and in 1788 won a gold medal for a painting inspired by John Dryden's ode Alexander's Feast that was especially praised by Reynolds. In 1793 Singleton was commissioned by the Royal Academy to paint the group portrait the Royal Academicians Assembled in their Council Chamber (London, Royal Academy). He soon became noted for his paintings inspired by the Bible and from literary sources, among them Manto and Tiresias (London, Tate Gallery) from John Dryden's Oedipus, and for his depictions of contemporary historical events, of which the watercolour Design Commemorative of the Abolition of the Slave Trade (1807; London, British Museum) is an example. Many of his works were engraved in mezzotint and achieved a widespread popularity. He also painted portraits, the writer James Boswell (c. 1795; Edinburgh, National Gallery) being one of his sitters. Many of Singleton's later works are inclined to be sentimental and were carelessly executed; they were often intended solely for engraving. Throughout his life he had a great love of Shakespeare, and many of his works illustrate scenes from the plays, among them Ariel on a Bat's Back (1819; London, Tate Gallery) taken from The Tempest; at the time of his death he had completed a series of over 90 such pictures. He also provided illustrations for books, including the Poems of Ossian (London, 1805), and for such periodicals as The Spectator, The Tatler and The Guardian. He exhibited at the Royal Academy until the year of his death. "

33844,Jacques Callot,1592,1635,"French engraver and draughtsman. He went to Italy when he was in his teens and, working in Rome and then in Florence at the court of the Grand Duke Cosimo II, he learnt to combine the sophisticated techniques and exaggerations of late Mannerism with witty and acute observation into a brilliantly expressive idiom. In 1621 he returned to France, and most of the remainder of his career was spent in his native Nancy, although he worked in Paris and the Low Countries. He made a speciality of beggars, and deformities, characters from the picaresque novel and the Italian commedia dell' arte. In this respects he comes close to Bellange, also active in Nancy, but Callot's style was more realistic. His last great work, the series of etchings entitled the Grandes Misères de la Guerre, followed the invasion of Lorraine by Cardinal Richelieu on 1633, and is a harrowing depiction of the atrocities of war; its themes and imagery were used as a source by Goya. Callot's output was prodigious; more than a thousand etchings and more than a thousand drawings by him are extant, and some his plates are large, featuring scores of figures. He was one of the first major creative artists to work exclusively in the graphic art. "

40469,Domenico Maria Canuti,1625,1684,"Italian painter. After training in Bologna under Guido Reni, Guercino, Giovanni Andrea Sirani and Francesco Gessi (1588-1649), he was in Rome from 1651 to 1655 under the patronage of Abbot Taddeo Pepoli, a distinguished Bolognese scholar. His Bolognese origins, specifically a debt to Reni and the Carracci, are apparent in the Ecstasy of St Cecilia (Imola, Santa Maria di Valverde), considered to be his first work. The Universal Judgment (Bologna, San Girolamo della Certosa), signed and dated 1658, shows the development of a more Baroque style. That he was also aware of Venetian painting is apparent in his first ceiling fresco, the Triumph of Bacchus and Ariadne (c. 1664; Bologna, Palazzo Fibbia, now Masetti-Calzolari), executed in collaboration with the quadraturista Domenico Santi, called Mengazzino (1621-1694). Here Canuti tried to conceal any distinction between the real space of the hall and his illusionistic spatial cone traversed by bands of radiating light. From 1650 to 1660 and later in the 1670s, he was employed in Rome where he painted the quadratura decoration of the ceiling of church of Santi Domenico e Sisto with the Apotheosis of Saint Dominic. He was often patronized by the Olivetans. He was employed with Francesco Cozza (1605-1682) and Carlo Maratti in the decoration of Palazzo Altieri. He also did frescoes in Palazzo Colonna. Returning to Bologna (c. 1657), he completed frescoes in the library of San Michele in Bosco and the Palazzo Pepoli Campogrande, and in the ducal palace at Mantua. He helped fresco the Palazzo Felicini in Bologna with Domenico Santi and Giacomo Alboresi (1632-1677). Canuti was also active as an engraver. Among his works are portraits of Ludovico, Agostino, and Annibale Carracci, The Virgin in the Clouds with Christ, and St Francis Praying after Guido Reni. From a young age, the painter enjoyed the protection of the Pepoli family. His light colours, his energetic approach, and his figural repertoire were clearly influenced by the Roman baroque, especially Lanfranco and Pietro da Cortona. Although he is now little known beyond the confines of his hometown, in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries he was thought to be equal of his teacher Guido Reni. "

30911,Narcisse Virgile Diaz de la Peña,1807,1876,"French landscape painter of the Barbizon School. He was born of Spanish parents in Bordeaux. His earlier works were Romantic compositions in the manner of Delacroix, but later he became a painter of the forest. He spent much time at Barbizon and although he is the least exalted of the half-dozen great artists who are usually grouped round that name, he sometimes produced works of the highest quality. At the age of ten Diaz became orphan, and misfortune dogged his earlier years. His foot was bitten by reptile in Meudon wood, near Sèvres, where he had been taken to live with some friends of his mother. The bite was badly dressed, and ultimately it cost him his leg. Afterwards his wooden stump became famous. About 1831 Diaz encountered Theodore Rousseau, four years his junior. At Fontainebleau, Diaz found Rousseau painting his wonderful forest pictures, and determined to paint in the same way. Diaz exhibited many pictures at the Paris Salon, and was decorated in 1851. During the Franco-German War he went to Brussels. After 1871 he became fashionable, his works gradually rose in the estimation of collectors. "

34051,Guillaume Courtois,1628,1679,"French painter, who together with his brother Jacques were active in Italy and often known by the Italian forms of the names, Giacomo and Guglielmo Cortese. They came from Burgundy and both had the nickname Il Borgognone or Le Bourguignon. At about age seven, painter's son Guillaume Courtois left France for Italy with his teenage brother. They followed the military campaigns that his brother drew, then studied in Bologna, Florence, and Siena, arriving in Rome by 1638. Courtois trained himself by copying Giovanni Lanfranco's and Andrea Sacchi's works and by drawing from nude models. He first studied under Pietro da Cortona, his most important teacher, while painting a fresco in an elegant Roman palazzo in 1656. In the following year he completed his first major public project, two frescoes for a Roman church. They display a strong sense of drama and a more naturalistic approach to the figure than did his later work, which followed the popular classicizing manner of Roman late Baroque painting. He painted the Battle of Joshua in the Quirinal Gallery, the Crucifixion of St Andrew in Sant'Andrea al Quirinale, various works for the Jesuits, some also in co-operation with his brother. His last production was Christ admonishing Martha. Courtois made many red chalk studies that demonstrate his great care in preparing the figures for his paintings. He also made composition drawings in pen, ink, and wash. "

He was called ""le Romain"" from his youthful residence at Rome. He first exhibited at the Paris Salon in 1727, and in 1728 he was received as a member of the Académie royal de peinture et de sculpture, with a Hercule et Omphale as his morceau de reception. In 1731 he was appointed painter to the tapestry manufacture at Aubusson and served in that capacity until 1755, forming a school of designers there that raised standards of quality. In addition to his paintings he practiced etching, in which medium he reproduced some of his paintings and some works by other artists. "

After initial artistic tuition from his father, he was apprenticed in London in 1749 to the marine painter Samuel Scott and remained with him for almost nine years. No extant marines can be confidently ascribed to Gilpin alone, though he is thought to have assisted Scott in the execution of some commissions during the 1750s. During this period Gilpin's sketches of horses and carts in Covent Garden reportedly brought him to the attention of William Augustus, Duke of Cumberland, by whom he was briefly employed around 1759. His watercolour studies made at Cumberland's stud-farm have been compared (and sometimes confused) with those of his fellow-employee Paul Sandby. Later patrons included Colonel Thornton of York, the indefatigable sportsman, and Samuel Whitbread, M.P. who became a life-long patron, and  to whose house at Southill he retired after the death of his wife in 1802. Gilpin collaborated with other artists including Turner, Marlow, Romney and Zoffany, for whom he painted the animals in landscapes and conversation pieces. Amongst his pupils were Gooch and George Garrard: the latter married his eldest daughter Matilda. Gilpin exhibited at the Society of Artists from 1762-1783, where he was elected President in 1774, and at the Royal Academy from 1786-1807, where he was elected a full Royal Academician in 1797, an honour never received by his contemporary George Stubbs, with whom his contemporaries frequently compared his work.

37153,Enea Vico,1523,1567,"Italian engraver. He trained in Parma and by 1541 was in Rome, where he became a pupil of Tommaso Barlacchi (fl 1527-42). In 1541-42, in collaboration with Barlacchi, he produced his first work, a series of 24 engravings with grotesque decorations in imitation of antique paintings. In Rome, Vico was also influenced by the printmakers Agostino dei Musi, Antonio Salamanca and, above all, Marcantonio Raimondi. Vasari recorded that in 1546, following a short period in Florence, where he made engravings for Grand Duke Cosimo I de' Medici after works by Michelangelo, Vico applied to live in Venice. He remained there until 1563, when he was summoned to the court of Alfonso II d'Este, Duke of Ferrara, where he lived until his death. "
32351,Giuseppe Nogari,1669,1763,"Italian painter. Recorded as a member of the Venetian guild of painters from 1726 onwards, he is traditionally thought to have been trained under Antonio Balestra, although it is more likely that his true master was Giovanni Battista Piazzetta. From his earliest known works, the four Heads (before 1736; Stockholm, Nationalmuseum) painted for the patron and collector Count Carl Gustav Tessin, it is evident that Nogari was influenced by the portraits of Rosalba Carriera and in particular the work of Rembrandt, whose drawings Nogari knew when they were in the collection formed by Zaccaria Sagredo. Nogari would also have known the Rembrandt prints owned from 1720 by Anton Maria Zanetti the elder. By the end of the 1730s Nogari's fame had spread to collectors in Germany, who acquired several works of a predominantly religious nature (all untraced). Between 1736 and 1739 as many as 14 Heads (all untraced) were sent back to Germany by Johan Matthias von der Schulenburg. From 1739 to 1742 Nogari painted four Heads for the Savoy family (Turin, Galleria Sabauda) and then contributed to the decoration of the Palazzo Reale in Turin, with allegories celebrating the glory of his patrons (now divided between the Palazzo Reale and the smaller palace of Stupinigi). These reveal an interest in the Rococo style and the work of Jacopo Amigoni. After his return to Venice in 1743, Nogari worked for Francesco Algarotti, then acting for Frederick-Augustus II, Elector of Saxony, painting two Philosophers and three Heads (all Dresden, Gemäldegalerie). During the same period, he also worked for the British Consul in Venice, Joseph Smith, producing two Heads and seven Portraits of Artists (London, Hampton Court, Royal Collection; Edinburgh, Palace Holyroodhouse, Royal Collection). For German collectors he produced two Allegories (both before 1749; Kassel, Gemäldegalerie). During the early 1750s Nogari worked on several altarpieces for churches in the Veneto, notably Christ Giving the Keys to St Peter in the cathedral at Bassano and the Miracle of St Joseph of Copertino in the Frari in Venice. In 1756 he was invited to become a member of the Venetian Accademia di Pittura e Scultura. In the 1750s he also continued to work for the German market and executed, for example, six paintings for Sigismund Streit (1687-1775), of which four Allegories survive (Berlin, Gemäldegalerie). Nogari's most significant pupil was the portrait painter Alessandro Longhi. "

14799,Carlo Lasinio,1759,1838,"Italian engraver, active mainly in Florence. He started as a painter at the Accademia di Belle Arti, Venice. He quickly placed more emphasis on printmaking, especially after moving to Florence in 1778. He established his reputation with two large series of etchings in 1787 and 1789. Lasinio also taught engraving at the Accademia in Florence, becoming a Professor in 1800. Lasinio moved to Pisa in 1807, taking up the position of ""conservatore"" of the Camposanto. He made considerable efforts to protect the Camposanto and its frescoes from ruin, from which it was threatened due to the destructive effects of the Napoleonic wars. In 1812 he began his influential book of etchings, recording the frescoes in the Camposanto. This was entitled, Pitture a fresco del Campo Santo di Pisa. These large etchings were composed in the sharply defined ""outline style"", which was popular in the early nineteenth century. These works proved to be very influential on 19th-century European art, particularly on the Pre-Raphaelites in Britain. According to William Holman Hunt, study of Lasinio's book convinced the group to reject High Renaissance art in favour of these earlier works. Lasinio's engravings also proved an important record of the frescoes, which were eventually severely damaged by bombing in World War II. Other works depicting the old masters included his forty plates of Frescoes and Oil Paintings at Florence (1789), large etchings which delineated the most famous Renaissance frescoes in Florence; and thirty-two plates of Frescoes of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Centuries. Among his other activities Lasinio also founded the Academy in Pisa, where he died. Apart from his many series of engravings and etchings, Lasinio also created original images. His portrayals of eminent Italians include the great explorers, Christopher Columbus and Amerigo Vespucci. His son, Giovanni Paolo Lasinio, was also an engraver. "

36312,Marcantonio Raimondi,1475,1534,"Italian engraver, pioneer in the use of prints to reproduce the work of other artists. He studied with Francia and learned much from Dürer's engravings in Venice (Dürer is said to have complained to the Venetian senate about being plagiarizes). In about 1510 he settled in Rome and thereafter worked mainly for Raphael, his engravings helping to spread the master's style throughout Europe. Apart from his association with Raphael, Raimondi is best known for his series of erotic engravings (after designs by Giulio Romano), that led to his imprisonment in 1524. He left Rome after the Sack of 1527 and died in obscurity in Bologna. "

35752,Willard LeRoy Metcalf,1858,1925,"American painter and illustrator. His formal education was limited, and at 17 he was apprenticed to the painter George Loring Brown of Boston. He was one of the first scholarship students admitted to the school of art sponsored by the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, and took classes there in 1877 and 1878. After spending several years illustrating magazine articles on the Zuni Indians of New Mexico, he decided to study abroad and in 1883 left for Paris. There he studied at the Académie Julian under Jules Lefebvre and Gustave Boulanger. During the five years he spent in France he became intimately acquainted with the countryside around the villages of Grez-sur-Loing and Giverny. He returned to America in 1888 and in the following spring exhibited oil studies executed in France, England and Africa at the St Botolph Club in Boston. It was not until Metcalf returned to the New York in 1904 and began again to paint American landscapes that his genius was revealed. Three summers painting at the Impressionist art colony at Old Lyme, Connecticut, culminated in what is one of his masterworks, May Night (1906, Corcoran Gallery of Art, Washington), which was awarded a gold medal at the Corcoran Biennial in 1907 and was purchased by the Corcoran Gallery. In the summer of 1906 the St. Botolph Club of Boston invited Metcalf to prepare an exhibition of his paintings to be installed that fall.  Metcalf lent eighteen canvases including summer moonlit scenes and autumnal landscapes. The St. Botolph showing was both a critical and financial success with ten of the canvases selling. Metcalf continued to paint Impressionist landscapes for the remainder of his career. In the later part of his career, Metcalf received great acclaim and became renowned in particular for his snow scenes. In 1924 the Metropolitan Museum of Art purchased The North Country (1923), a snow scene, and that same year, Metcalf was notified of his election to the American Academy of Arts and Letters. On New Years Day 1925 a retrospective exhibition of Metcalf's art opened at the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington. He attended the opening, but shortly thereafter his health rapidly declined. Metcalf died on March 9, 1925. "

103665,Zanino di Pietro,,,"Italian painter, known also as Giovanni di Francia or Giovanni di Pietro Charlier. With Niccolò di Pietro and Jacobello del Fiore, Zanino di Pietro was one of the major Venetian painters of the first quarter of the 15th century. His activity in Bologna, repeatedly documented between 1389 and 1406, was of crucial importance for the pungent narrative style and naturalistic details of his earliest signed painting, a folding Crucifixion triptych painted for the Franciscan convent of Fonte Colombo (Rieti, Museo Civico). The inscription describes the artist as h[ab]itator ve[n]eciis i[n] contrata sa[nc]te a[ppol]linaris, and it is therefore datable to c. 1405, when Zanino seems to have moved permanently to Venice. Whether the triptych reflects the work of Gentile da Fabriano, who was active in Venice by 1408, or whether Zanino was instrumental in transmitting an Emilian style to Gentile cannot be answered satisfactorily. The most important commission of his career was that of decorating the façade of the Ca d'Oro in Venice, received shortly after his completion of the pulpit in the church of the Carità in the same city. Zanino's subsequent paintings reveal the influence of both Gentile and Michelino da Besozzo, who was active in Venice by 1410. The most important are two polyptychs in the Museo Diocesano, Camerino, and the Convento del Beato Sante, Mombarroccio, both in the Marches, the iconostasis of Torcello Cathedral and the fresco decoration of the tomb of the Beato Pacifico (1437; Venice, S Maria Gloriosa dei Frari).

42248,Charles Percier,1764,1838,"French architect and interior designer, partner with Pierre Fontaine. This pair of architects redesigned the Tuileries Palace, Paris, and Saint-Cloud, for the Emperor Napoleon from circa 1801 to 1804. They were named ""architectes du gouvernement"" by Napoleon in 1801 and ""Architectes du Louvre et des Tuileries"" in 1804. They helped create the influential Empire style of interior decoration. Percier and Fontaine became acquainted with each other while both were studying architecture in Paris. Percier won the Prix de Rome in 1786 and spent the following years studying in Rome with Fontaine, who became his lifelong friend. They returned to Paris in 1790 and set up their own practice; their work eventually attracted the attention of Josephine Bonaparte, Napoleon's wife, and she engaged them to renovate her Château de Malmaison (1800-03). From then on the Bonapartes became their principal patrons. In their subsequent decorative work Percier and Fontaine virtually invented the severe but elegant Neoclassical blend of Greco-Roman and Egyptian forms and motifs that became known as the Empire style. They redid interiors, walls, and ceilings and designed furniture, accessories, and ornament for the old royal palaces and the new residences of the Bonapartes. Much of their work was done on the Louvre and the Tuileries palaces; they designed the arcades of the rue de Rivoli and the rue de Castiglione along the Louvre and designed the Arc de Triomphe du Carrousel connecting the Louvre and Tuileries (1806-08). They also worked on the Château de Saint-Cloud and the Château de Fontainebleau. They also influenced taste through their publications, including 'Palais, maisons et autres édifices modernes dessinés a Rome' (1798; 'Palaces, Houses, and Other Modern Buildings Drawn in Rome') and 'Recueil de décorations intérieures' (1801 and 1812; 'Collection of Interior Designs'). Financing grew scarce in the later years of the Empire, and the return of the Bourbons in 1814 aborted several grandiose Napoleonic building projects and sent Percier into permanent retirement. Fontaine remained active, designing the sombre Neoclassical Chapelle Expiatoire (1815-26) in Paris and continuing to restore the Louvre-Tuileries complex under both Charles X and Louis-Philippe. He retired in 1848. "

He was a draughtsman, lithographer, etcher, and portrait painter, and also wrote treatises on art, including the influential work Essai sur les signes inconditionnels dans l'art (Leiden, 1827). Humbert de Superville was a son of Jean Humbert, a Dutch painter of Swiss and French extraction. His brother, military engineer Jean Emile Humbert, is credited with rediscovering the lost city of Carthage. Humbert de Superville's assumed name of Giottino was originally a nickname he was given in Italy because his work showed similarities with the Italian master Giotto. He also took the last name de Superville after his grandmother Emilie de Superville, daughter of the eminent French Calvinist theologian Daniel de Superville, who had fled to the Dutch republic in 1685. He left the Netherlands for Rome from 1789 and lived there until 1800, when the Papal State was restored and Humbert de Superville was forced to leave the city because he had supported the 1798 occupation of Rome by French revolutionary troops. In 1812 he settled in the Dutch town of Leiden and became a lecturer at the University of Leiden. He served as head of the Leiden drawing academy Ars Aemula Naturae (1814-1823) and as first director of the Leiden cabinet of prints, drawings and plaster statues (1825-1849). His 1801 etching Allegory may have been a direct visual inspiration for Paul Gauguin's Spirit of the Dead Watching. Although no direct connection has been made, de Superville had been cited by Albert Aurier as one of the forerunners of Symbolist painting and de Superville's book Unconditional Signs in Art (1827-32) was widely known to that group.

36365,Sebastiano Ricci,1659,1734,"Italian decorative painter. He was born in Belluno and is considered a member of the Venetian school, but before he settled in Venice in 1717 he led a peripatetic life, working in numerous Italian cities (Bologna, Rome, Modena, Florence, and Parma) before going to Vienna where he worked in the Schönbrunn Palace. In 1712 he went to England with his nephew, Marco Ricci. They left in 1716, after Sebastiano failed to get the commissions to decorate the dome of St Paul's and Hampton Court Palace. He returned to Venice, and on the way home he stopped in Paris and visited Watteau, some of whose drawings he copied. His unsettled existence is a reflection not only of the demand for his talents but also of his penchant for illicit love affairs, which often led to his having to move in haste, and once almost resulted in his execution. In view of this it is not surprising that his work is uneven and sometimes shows signs of carelessness, but he had a gift for vivid, fresh colouring, and his itinerant career was important in spreading knowledge of Italian decorative painting. Little of the decorative work he did in England survives except the Resurrection in the apse of the Chelsea Hospital Chapel and some large but damaged canvases on the staircase at Burlington House (now the Royal Academy).

36220,Bernardino Poccetti,1548,1612,"Bernardino Poccetti (Bernardo Barbatelli), Italian painter and draughtsman. He was trained in Florence by Michele Tosini, a pupil of Ridolfo Ghirlandaio, and at 22 was admitted to the Compagnia di San Luca and later the Accademia del Disegno. His skill as a fresco painter of façades earned him the sobriquets 'Bernardino delle facciate', '...delle muse' and '...delle grottesche'. Surviving examples include the façade of the Palazzo di Bianca Capello, Florence. His six lunettes of the Life of St Dominic (c. 1582-84; Florence, S Maria Novella, Chiostro Grande) owe much to Andrea del Sarto for the clear compositions and individual figures and to the new emphasis on naturalism of Santi di Tito for the narrative simplicity. Poccetti's progress from small-scale sgraffito decorations to large-scale compositions was aided by drawings supplied by Alessandro Allori. The frescoes celebrating the Capponi family (1583-87; Florence, Palazzo Capponi, Sala Grande) refer to some of the 132 tapestry designs of Joannes Stradanus (e.g. Florence, Palazzo Vecchio) and to his engraved series of the Medicae familiae. Northern sources are also apparent in Poccetti's work. The lunettes of the Martyrdom of the Apostles (c. 1585-90; Florence, San Pier Maggiore, courtyard) show the influence of Lucas Cranach the Elder and Hendrik Goltzius. Albrecht Dürer's Small Woodcut Passion inspired the Calvary and Christ Nailed to the Cross (Florence, San Pier Maggiore, vestibule). "

He produced polychrome enamels of religious subjects borrowing details from woodcuts. He was one of the earliest masters to exercise a style that contrasted dramatically with the vivid colours employed in the earlier champlevé period. Enamels painted in Lyon were dark and sombre, reflecting the pessimism prevalent during the Reformation. "

71601,Peter Flötner,1480,1546,"Peter Flötner (Flettner), German sculptor, medallist, cabinetmaker, woodcutter and designer. It has been conjectured on stylistic grounds that between 1515 and 1518 he was active in Augsburg and worked in Hans Daucher's workshop on the sculptural decoration (destroyed) of the Fugger funerary chapel in St Anna. His early style was formed by the Italianism of Daucher and of Hans Burgkmair and also by a journey to Italy in 1520-21. He was briefly active in Ansbach before arriving in 1522 in Nuremberg; there he was documented as master sculptor when receiving citizenship in August 1523. His earliest sculptural work in Nuremberg is thought to have been 22 capitals (early 1520s) for the renovated Rathaus (destroyed in 1945). The use of Italian Renaissance ornament, such as volutes decorated with acanthus leaves and fluting, represented a progressive development, in contrast to Albrecht Dürer's Gothic-inspired architectural design of the Ehrenpforte. Flötner's first-hand study of Italian Renaissance architectural vocabulary is apparent in the ornamentation of the pilasters of the triangular fountain (1526) in the Markt at Mainz, commissioned by Cardinal Albrecht von Brandenburg. Most of the motifs he used, such as vases with arabesques of combined acanthus leaves and vine leaves extending into grotesque figures or dolphins, are derived from Lombard architectural works, such as the portals of the Certosa di Pavia. Flötner's work was important in spreading the Renaissance style in Northern Europe. His best-known work is the Apollo Fountain (Germanisches Nationalmuseum, Nuremberg, 1532), which is classical in inspiration but with a flowing elegance that is Flötner's own. "

In 1792 he entered his first mark in partnership with William Frisbee but within months registered his own hallmark, and by 1796 he had set up a workshop in Air Street, London. His earliest works were in a restrained neoclassical style, but such was the quality of his work that soon after 1800 he began working, apparently exclusively, for Rundell Bridge and Rundell - the royal goldsmiths, after which his work was executed in the firm's elaborate house style. In 1811 he became a partner of Rundell's and moved his workshops to Dean Street. He left the firm in 1819 and turned to the execution of more naturalistic designs. A partnership started in 1822 with John Mortimer, a Bond Street retailer, was far from financially or temperamentally ideal but was maintained until 1838, when Storr retired to Tooting, where he lived until his death.

A pastry-cook by profession, Henstenburgh was also an amateur painter of gorgeous bouquets of flowers and still-lifes, in some cases also accompanied by small animals. Henstenburgh's teacher was Johannes Bronckhorst, a fellow native of Hoorn, who also instructed him in the secondary craft of baking, presumably to guarantee his pupil a good livelihood even if his artistic stock should fail to rise. According to the near-contemporary chronicler, Johan van Gool, Henstenburgh started out by depicting birds and landscapes, and then broadened his repertoire after about 1695 to include flower and fruit pieces. Van Gool went on to explain the extraordinary richness of Henstenburgh's colours by claiming that the artist had invented a new type of watercolour. "

33833,Giuseppe Cades,1750,1799,"Italian painter. He trained at Rome's Accademia di San Luca but left in 1766 when his master came to resent his excessive independence. When he received his first important commissions in the early 1770s, he employed a late Baroque classicist style inspired by Carlo Maratta. Around 1774, through his association with Johann Heinrich Fuseli's circle, he began adopting influences from Mannerist and Renaissance painting, as well as the antique. Cades painted subjects from religious history and Greek, Roman, and Italian Renaissance literature. Although he remained in Rome throughout his career, He further expanded his artistic education by touring northern Italy. He worked on many decorative projects for Roman palazzi and villas and made easel paintings for churches and private patrons. In the 1780s, as his reputation grew, Cades became a fellow at the Accademia di San Luca, and his clients included Catherine the Great of Russia. "

His best works are usually on a small scale, marked by subtle silvery-gray tonalities, but he achieved one memorable feat on a much larger scale. In 1637 he was called upon to finish the group portrait of the Amsterdam Civic Guards known as the Meagre Company (Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam) that Frans Hals began in 1633 and refused to finish because he would not come to Amsterdam for sittings, and Codde succeeded so well in capturing Hals's spirit and the touch of his brush that experts still disagree where the work of the one ends and the other begins. Codde also wrote poetry. "

Le Sueur was one of the founders and first professors of the Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture. Le Sueur studied under the painter Simon Vouet and was admitted at an early age into the guild of master painters. Some paintings reproduced in tapestry brought him notice, and his reputation was further enhanced by a series of decorations for the Hôtel Lambert that he left uncompleted. He painted many pictures for churches and convents, among the most important being St. Paul Preaching at Ephesus (Louvre), and his famous series of 22 paintings of the Life of St. Bruno (Louvre), executed in the cloister of the Chartreux. Stylistically dominated by the art of Nicolas Poussin, Raphael, and Vouet, Le Sueur had a graceful facility in drawing and was always restrained in composition by a fastidious taste. "

Giovanni Gioseffo first apprenticed with Domenico Maria Canuti, and then in 1672, he entered the Roman studio of Lorenzo Pasinelli. He painted frescoes in the cupola of Santa Maria dei Poveri in Bologna, and an altarpiece of the Trinity (1700) for the chiesa del Suffragio in Imola. He is said to have collaborated with Giuseppe Maria Crespi. He was one of the painters who contributed to painting mythologic scenes for the renowned Aeneid Gallery of the Palazzo Buonaccorsi in Macerata; a decoration that employed many of the premier artists of his day. Two paintings, Diana with Cupids and Ecstasy of the Magdalen are found in the Palazzo Spalletti-Trivelli in Bologna. There is a Salome with the St John the Baptist in the Fitzwilliam Museum attributed to Giovanni Gioseffo. He also frescoed the Palazzo Mansi in Lucca with a Judgement of Paris. He had many pupils, among them Felice Torelli and Donato Creti. "

An apprentice in cameo cutting at 13, he gained mastery over low-relief sculpture. He had an unusual genius for plastic expression and an unfailing enthusiasm and industry. He studied drawing at Cooper Institute (now Cooper Union) and the National Academy of Design. Moving (1867) to Paris, he was trained at the École des Beaux-Arts, Paris, and gained knowledge of the Italian Renaissance from his stay (1870-75) in Italy. He returned to America where between 1880 and 1897 he executed most of the works that earned him his reputation as the foremost American sculptor of the late 19th century. His statue of Admiral Farragut (1881) for Madison Square, New York City, set a new standard for public monuments and made Saint-Gaudens one the foremost Beaux-Arts sculptors in the United States and a strong influence in the development of American sculpture. Stanford White collaborated on the pedestal for this figure and several others. In 1887 the figure of Lincoln in Lincoln Park, Chicago, was completed. Other works that followed are Deacon Samuel Chapin (The Puritan), Springfield, Mass.; the Shaw Memorial, Boston Common; General Logan, Chicago; General Sherman, entrance to Central Park, New York City; and the seated Lincoln for the Chicago lakefront. Of the portrait tablets and plaques, most notable are Dr. McCosh, Princeton, N.J.; Robert Louis Stevenson for St. Giles, Edinburgh, Scotland; and charming low reliefs of children. Among his idealized figures is the veiled Adams Memorial, Rock Creek Cemetery, Washington, D.C., one of his most splendid works. "

He adopted his father's smooth, enamel-like style, but besides genre pieces also produced portraits, landscapes and history pieces. After 1700 Van Mieris specialised in shop and kitchen interiors depicted behind an arched opening. He devoted much attention to detail, and many important collectors liked his dispassionate, meticulous style. For several years Van Mieris was leader of the St Luke's guild in Leiden. Around 1694 he set up a drawing academy with the artists Toorenvliet and De Moor. His apprentices included his son, Frans van Mieris II. The school remained in existence until 1736, by which time Van Mieris had become partially blind. "

Although the Dutch painter Charles Rochussen taught the students history and landscape painting, Breitner's interests did not lie in this area. In 1880 he worked for a year in the studio of Willem Maris after his academy training. Maris belonged to the Hague school of painters, who worked in the plein-air tradition of the French Barbizon school. Breitner painted outdoor life with them, although it was not the picturesqueness of the landscape or the Dutch skies that appealed to him. In the early 1880s, he and Vincent van Gogh painted the residents of the working class neighbourhoods of The Hague and in the province of Drenthe. Both artists recorded the vitality of city life in their sketchbooks. Breitner consciously chose these themes and motifs: he wanted to paint people going about their daily lives, and on his trips through the towns and docks he was constantly in search of motifs and impressions that he could use in his paintings. In 1884 Breitner went to Paris, he met Toulouse-Lautrec and Bernard in the Cormon studio. In 1886 he settled in Amsterdam. He painted urban life in a lively manner with naturalistic perspicacity and delicate colouring. He later reduced his palette to black, white, ochre and brown. He also painted landscapes, portraits, genre pictures, and nudes. His works are marked by a sharp characterization of forms, delicacy of feeling, freedom of brush work, and expressive contrasts and nuances in treatment of light and shade. He frequently depicted the life of the Amsterdam streets, either noisy and bustling or quiet and deserted at different times of the year. Between 1903 and 1906 he lived in Aerdenbout near Haarlem. He made several trips abroad, including Berlin, London, Ghent, Norway, and in 1908, Pittsburgh. "

His animosity toward Caravaggio is shown in almost every line of his biography. On the other hand, he was despised and derided by Caravaggio's clique. As an artist Baglione was, strangely enough, a follower of Caravaggio, especially in his use of light and dark. He published a long list of his works at the end of his autobiography, but in spite of some very interesting performances, he never really developed a consistent and expressive artistic personality.

41219,Jan Frans van Bloemen,1662,1749,"Flemish painter, member of a Flemish family of painters and draughtsmen, active also in Italy and France, brother of Pieter van Bloemen. While still in their native Antwerp, Pieter was the first teacher of his brother Jan Frans - who later also studied with Antoine Goubau - and probably also of his younger brother Norbert (1670-c. 1746). From 1667 Pieter had himself trained with Simon van Douw (c. 1630-c. 1677). He is recorded in Lyon c. 1684. At about the same time Jan Frans was in Paris, until he was summoned by his brother to Lyon. There Jan Frans apparently worked with van der Cabel. The two brothers were not happy in Lyon, however, and went to Rome. They travelled via Turin, staying there for some time. From 1686-87 they were in Rome, where they were both members of the Schildersbent, the confraternity of Dutch and Flemish artists active in Rome. Pieter was given the bent or nickname Standaart (or Stendardo), undoubtedly a reference to the banners and standards that he depicted in his scenes of soldiers; Jan Frans's facility for producing panoramic landscapes earned him the nickname Orizzonte (It.: 'horizon'), which had previously been applied to Claude Lorrain. Jan Frans did not leave Rome again, apart from an eight-month journey to Naples, Sicily and Malta, from which he returned with a large number of drawings. Jan Frans was married in Rome in 1693, and the Dutch artist Caspar van Wittel, known as 'Vanvitelli', was godfather to the couple's first child, baptized in 1694. Although patronized by aristocratic Roman families, Orizzonte's artistic career was marred by his prolonged confrontation with the Accademia di S Luca. The precise reasons for the difficulties are unknown, but he was only finally accepted by the Accademia at the age of 80, after his third application for membership. "

58468,Cristoforo Stati,1556,1619,"Italian sculptor and restorer, also called Cristofano da Bracciano. He was a little-known sculptor who also worked on the restoration of marble works excavated from archaeological sites. He trained in Florence in the circle of Bartolomeo Ammanati and Giambologna. This provided a Mannerist environment in which Stati acquired a good command of his craft and a certain elegance of style. Only a few of his works have been identified. These suggest that he was imbued with Classical culture, and wanted to recreate the artistic period that was recognized as a model of perfection: the Classicism of the age of Hadrian. During his time in Florence, between 1604 and October 1607, he carved the fountain with Samson Stopping the Lion's Mouth (Aranjuez, Jardín de la Isla). This formed a pair with another group, by Giambologna (Samson and a Philistine, 1565-70; London, Victoria and Albert Museum), which has been identified with a work in the gardens of Aranjuez Palace in Spain. During the same period he carved the group of Venus and Adonis (Bracciano, Palazzo) which was presented by the artist to his native town, as is attested by an original document held in the Archivio Comunale in Bracciano. The figure of Adonis takes its inspiration from a Roman copy of a statue of Antinous, while the Venus recalls a Classical type elaborated by Giambologna. "

35508,Pietro Longhi,1702,1785,"Italian painter, the son of a goldsmith (his real surname was Pietro Falca), Pietro Longhi tried without much success to become one of the group of eighteenth-century Venetian painters so much in demand for large-scale decorations. His youthful work included frescos in the Palazzo Sagredo which reveal his lack of talent in this field. But at about the age of 40, Longhi managed to find his own creative voice which soon made him a specialist in a highly successful new genre. Drawing on his memories of youthful studies with Giuseppe Maria Crespi (an important precursor to Longhi's brand of genre painting), he began painting small canvases on everyday subjects, showing real places and people. Unlike most view-painters at the same time, normally forced to seek foreign patrons, Longhi mainly worked for local patrons and collectors, including the noble families of Grimani, Barbarigo, and Manin. Longhi prepared his work by making careful preparatory sketches. He concentrated almost exclusively on small-scale canvases depicting the modest day-to-day activities of aristocratic Venetian families. The wonderful amiability of these episodes of no earth-shaking importance is marked by an observant, often gently satirical touch. The playwright Goldoni called Longhi a ""man seeking the truth"", but his was not a very harassing quest. In later life Longhi also produced two interesting cycles of paintings. One was a series showing the Seven Sacraments while the other depicted Hunters in the valley. Both are now in the Pinacoteca Querini-Stampalia in Venice. Longhi occasionally painted more than one version of his own compositions, and these again were often duplicated by pupils and followers. Alessandro Longhi (1733-1813), the son of Pietro, was a successful portraitist. "

In 1776 he visited Rome, and there studied under Mengs, together with Fuseli and Northcote (1746-1831). On returning to England in 1780 he painted for some time, exhibiting at the Royal Academy in 1781 and 1782. He ceased to exhibit after 1785. He was well-known for his portraits and historical scenes.

80317,Filippo Parodi,1630,1702,"Italian sculptor and wood-carver, part of a family of artists. Filippo first worked as a wood-carver and went to Rome twice, staying for six years each time. The time Parodi spent in Rome is vital for the understanding of the stylistic characteristics of his work. The crowning of the pediment of the altar of the Virgin in Santa Maria delle Vigne, Genoa, with allegorical figures of Faith, Hope and Charity follows a composition that occurs frequently in Roman churches, and four statues representing characters from Ovid's Metamorphoses (Narcissus, Hyacinth, Heliantha and Flora, all Genoa, Palazzo Reale) reveal a thorough knowledge of Roman Baroque sculpture. These works, and a large carved wooden looking-glass in the Villa Durazzo at Albisola, Genoa, probably date not much later than 1661. The French sculptor Pierre Puget was in Genoa from 1661 to 1667, and his influence can be seen in the caryatids on the jambs of the gate to the garden of the Palazzo Brignole and the statue of the Virgin and Child in San Carlo Genoa, which formed the prototype for other Virgin and Child groups (e.g. Sampierdarena, Santa Maria della Cella). Parodi's supple figures, the drapery full of movement, and the figure types are all clearly derived from Puget. A second journey to Rome seems to be reflected in the monumental St Martha in Ecstasy (Genoa, Santa Marta), inspired by Melchiorre Cafà's Ecstasy of St Catherine of Siena (completed 1667; Rome, Santa Caterina da Siena a Monte Magnanopoli), and the statue of St John the Baptist (documented, 1677) in Santa Maria Assunta di Carignano in Genoa. Around 1678 Parodi went to Venice to execute the funerary monument to the patriarch Francesco Morosini (completed 1683; Venice, San Nicola da Tolentino). Here he adopted Bernini's idea of a large cloth hanging against the wall, held up by angels and opening to reveal the sarcophagus, around which stand the allegorical figures of Fame, Charity and Time. A preparatory drawing for the monument (Florence, Uffizi), shows that he altered the original design considerably in the final execution. Parodi moved to Padua in 1685 to start work on the Deposition of Christ (completed c. 1690; Padua, Santa Giustina) and the funerary monument to Orazio Secco (signed and dated 1686; Padua, San Antonio). On 23 December 1687, he was back in Venice, where he was employed by the Senate to sculpt the bust of Doge Francesco Morosini (two copies survive: marble, Venice, Correr; bronze, Venice, Palazzo Ducale). Back in Padua in 1689, Parodi began work on the decoration of the Cappella del Tesoro in the Santo. This consisted of a large, polychrome marble concave structure with three niches within which the relics and liturgical objects were displayed. The whole is surmounted by marble statues of St Anthony, St Francis, St Bonaventure and the allegories of Faith, Charity, Humility and Penitence. The composition was designed by Parodi, but some stucco angels were executed by his pupil Pietro Roncaioli (active 1600-1660). Parodi worked on this sumptuous complex until the end of 1697 and it was finally completed, after his death, in 1705. There are no known works by him after 1699. Another of Parodi's pupils was Giacomo Antonio Ponsonelli, who collaborated on numerous projects until Parodi's death and whose work on these projects is difficult to distinguish from that of his master.

He was in Rome in 1598 and back in Antwerp by 1601. A second visit to Italy seems likely, for although in 1601 he was painting in a Mannerist style (Diana and Callisto, Museum of Fine Arts, Budapest), by 1909 (Scaldis and Antwerpia, Musée Royal, Antwerp) his work had become much more solid, sober, and classical, suggesting close knowledge of Caravaggio in particular. For the next decade Janssens was one of the most powerful and individual painters in Flanders, but during the 1620s his work became less remarkable as he fell under the all-pervasive influence of Rubens. His pupils included Gerard Seghers and Theodoor Rombouts. His son, Abraham Janssens II was also painter and pupil of his father. "

Probably from Gais, South Tyrol, he was first recorded in Brixen (now Bressanone, Italy) in 1478 and can perhaps be identified with the Master Hans Maler who is mentioned many times in the cathedral records between 1477 and 1498. Rather than a panel painter, he is likely to have been a surveyor and head of a workshop producing complete altarpieces, including both sculpture and painting. In 1478-79 he employed four assistants and was one of the leading employers in Brixen. He also produced works for Bozen (now Bolzano, Italy) and its region. He was Mayor of Brixen in 1497-98; his last documented work (the retable of the former Franciscan church in Bolzano) dates from 1500. "

33389,Alessandro Algardi,1598,1654,"Italian sculptor, the son of a silk merchant from Bologna. He was trained under Lodovico Carracci at the Accademia degli Incamminati, where he acquired the skills of a first-rate draftsman. After a short period of activity in Mantua (1622), he moved to Rome (1625), where he designed the stucco decorations in San Silvestro al Quirinale and gained some success as a restorer of classical sculptures. With the monument of Cardinal Mellini (d. 1629) in Santa Maria del Popolo, the Frangipani monument in San Marcello al Corso, and the bust of Cardinal Laudivio Zacchia, Algardi emerged as the principal rival of Gian Lorenzo Bernini in the field of portrait sculpture. Lacking Bernini's dynamic vitality and penetrating characterization, Algardi's portraits were appreciated for their sobriety and surface realism. Algardi had no major commissions for monumental works until the mid-1630s, when he received three. In July 1634 he signed the contract for the tomb of Pope Leo XI (marble, completed 1644, erected 1652; Rome, St Peter's). Leo XI reigned as pontiff a mere 27 days in April 1605 (the commission came from the pope's great-nephew, Cardinal Roberto Ubaldini). Algardi emphasized Leo's munificence with allegorical figures of liberality and magnanimity as well as the relief sculpture Cardinal de' Medici's Legation to France. Unlike Bernini's tomb for Pope Alexander VII, which combined white and coloured marble with bronze, Algardi's papal tomb was sculpted entirely from white marble. In October 1634 Algardi signed the contract for the over life-size, free-standing group, the Beheading of St Paul (marble, completed 1644; Bologna, San Paolo Maggiore). This important commission came from the Spada family and was intended to form part of the unusually lavish high altar designed by Bernini as a memorial to Paolo Spada (d 1631). It is unclear which of the two artists was responsible for the composition of the group, which is full of tension, though it has limited dramatic impact. Algardi's third major monumental commission of the 1630s is the over life-size marble group of St Filippo Neri with an Angel (1635–38; Rome, Santa Maria in Vallicella), carved for Pietro Buoncompagni, a descendant of a Roman Jewish family who possibly had Bolognese connections. It stands above the sacristy altar and was intended to provide the focal-point of a vista from a side entrance to the church in the right transept. After the election of Pope Innocent X (1644), Algardi superseded Bernini in papal favour. Between this date and his death in 1654, Algardi produced some of his most celebrated works, among them the seated statue of Innocent X now in the Palazzo dei Conservatori (1645) and a colossal marble relief of the Meeting of Attila and Pope Leo in St. Peter's (1646–53), which influenced the development and popularization of illusionistic reliefs. Although he was generally less theatrical than Bernini, Algardi in this work effectively created a larger than life-size narrative whose principal events are dramatically conveyed. At this time Algardi also designed the Villa Doria Pamphili and a fountain in the Cortile di San Damaso of the Vatican. Algardi's style is less ebullient and pictorial than Bernini's, and, even in such typically Baroque works as the tomb of Pope Leo XI in St. Peter's (1634–52) and the high altar of San Paolo at Bologna (1641), the restraining influence of the antique is strongly evident.

His activity as a painter is only documented from 1803 onwards, when Speeckaert was already 55 years old. He participated at the Salons of Antwerp, Brussels, Ghent, Paris, Lille and Douai. "

After five years at the Academy in his native Copenhagen, he reached Rome in 1797 on 3 March, a day which he henceforth considered as his birthday. He made his name with the statue Jason (Thorvaldsens Museum, Copenhagen, 1802-03), which was based on the Doryphoros of Polyclitus, and his growing reputation resulted in so many commissions that by 1820 he had forty assistants in his Roman workshop. In that year, when visiting Copenhagen, he began planning the decoration of the newly built church of Our Lady with marble statues and reliefs, a scheme which was to be his principal task for several years. His other major works include the tomb of Pius VII at St Peter's in Rome (1824-31) and a monument to Lord Byron (Trinity College, Cambridge, 1829). He returned finally to Denmark in 1838, a celebrity whose authority in the arts was sovereign. In Copenhagen a museum was built in his honour (1839-48), itself a remarkable piece of neo-antique architecture, the courtyard of which contains his tomb. Thorvaldsen aimed at reviving the sublimity of Greek sculpture, but he never went to Greece and (in common with other artists of his time) bestowed his admiration mainly on late Hellenistic or Roman copies. He did, however, gain close knowledge of Greek sculpture from the restorations he made to the recently excavated sculptures from the Temple of Aphaia in Aegina, which in 1816 passed through Rome on their way to Munich (they are now in the Glyptothek there); Thorvaldsen's restorations have only recently been removed. Compared with Canova he is cool and calculating; his sculptures are more logically worked out and have great precision and clarity, but they lack Canova's sensitive surfaces. Thorvaldsen was one of the outstanding collectors of his day, buying works by contemporary painters (notably the Nazarenes) as well as ancient works (now in the Thorvaldsens Museum). "

However, he was trained in Siena, though his only surviving work there, a Visitation in the church of Fontegiusta, shows the importance of Sodoma in the formation of his art. Anselmi's family was apparently from Parma, but he is not securely documented there until 1520. In that year he began to paint in San Giovanni Evangelista, where he decorated the ribs of the nave vaults, the apses of both transepts and at least two chapels: the chapel in the north transept, with frescoes of Sts Agnes and Catherine, and the sixth chapel on the left of the nave, with frescoes of the Four Doctors of the Church. It has also been suggested that he executed the frescoes of Sts Nicholas and Hilary in the fourth chapel on the left, which have been attributed to Parmigianino. In 1525 Anselmi was one of the group of prominent artists consulted about the construction of Santa Maria della Steccata, Parma, where his most extensive works in fresco were subsequently painted. These comprise the Coronation of the Virgin (1541-42, altered 1547) in the main apse, a commission that was given to him after the death of Parmigianino in 1540 and for which he was required to work from a 'coloured drawing' by Giulio Romano, and, on the facing apse and vault over the west door, an Adoration of the Magi and Four Prophets, which were completed by Bernardino Gatti.

His prints are unsigned and were for a long time attributed to René Boyvin, who was his pupil in 1549-50. He has been identified with the copper-plate engraver Pierre de La Cuffle, who is mentioned by Karel van Mander I. He was often in debt and was several times obliged to pledge his plates to his creditors, who included François Clouet. He remained in close contact with Boyvin, who in 1553 finished two plates begun by Milan. They worked together on the inventory drawn up on the death of Luca Penni in 1557. Zerner attributed seven engravings to him, including Dance of the Dryads after Rosso Fiorentino, Jupiter and Callisto after Francesco Primaticcio and Clelia Escaping from the Camp of Porsena after Giulio Romano. Perhaps the most interesting of the works attributed to him is the print of the Nymph of Fontainebleau, the only part of the decorative ensemble of the Galerie François I at the château of Fontainebleau to be engraved by the Parisian printmakers of the time. It contributed to the spread of the theme of Diana in French 16th-century engraving. It seems likely that some engravings attributed to Boyvin are by Milan. "

40561,Albrecht Dürer,1471,1528," Painter and printmaker generally regarded as the greatest German Renaissance artist. His vast body of work includes altarpieces and religious works, numerous portraits and self-portraits, and copper engravings. His woodcuts, such as the Apocalypse series (1498), retain a more Gothic flavour than the rest of his work. Dürer was the second son of the goldsmith Albrecht Dürer the Elder, who had left Hungary to settle in Nuremberg in 1455, and of Barbara Holper, who had been born there. Dürer began his training as a draughtsman in the goldsmith's workshop of his father. His precocious skill is evidenced by a remarkable self-portrait done in 1484, when he was 13 years old (Albertina, Vienna), and by a Madonna with Musical Angels, done in 1485, which is already a finished work of art in the late Gothic style. In 1486, Dürer's father arranged for his apprenticeship to the painter and woodcut illustrator Michael Wohlgemut, whose portrait Dürer would paint in 1516. After three years in Wohlgemuth's workshop, he left for a period of travel. In 1490 Dürer completed his earliest known painting, a portrait of his father (Uffizi, Florence) that heralds the familiar characteristic style of the mature master. Dürer's years as a journeyman probably took the young artist to the Netherlands, to Alsace, and to Basle, Switzerland, where he completed his first authenticated woodcut, a picture of St Jerome Curing the Lion (Kunstmuseum, Basle). During 1493 or 1494 Dürer was in Strasbourg for a short time, returning again to Basle to design several book illustrations. An early masterpiece from this period is a self-portrait with a thistle painted on parchment in 1493 (Louvre, Paris). At the end of May 1494, Dürer returned to Nuremberg, where he soon married Agnes Frey, the daughter of a merchant. In the autumn of 1494 Dürer seems to have undertaken his first journey to Italy, where he remained until the spring of 1495. A number of bold landscape watercolours dealing with subjects from the Alps of the southern Tirol were made on this journey and are among Dürer's most beautiful creations. Depicting segments of landscape scenery cleverly chosen for their compositional values, they are painted with broad strokes, in places roughly sketched in, with an amazing harmonization of detail. Dürer used predominantly unmixed, cool, sombre colours, which, despite his failure to contrast light and dark adequately, still suggest depth and atmosphere. The trip to Italy had a strong effect on Dürer; direct and indirect echoes of Italian art are apparent in most of his drawings, paintings, and graphics of the following decade. While in Venice and perhaps also before he went to Italy, Dürer saw engravings by masters from central Italy. He was most influenced by the Florentine Antonio Pollaiuolo, with his sinuous, energetic line studies of the human body in motion, and by the Venetian Andrea Mantegna,. an artist greatly preoccupied with classical themes and with precise linear articulation of the human figure. Dürer's secular, allegorical, and frequently self-enamoured paintings of this period are often either adaptations of Italian models or entirely independent creations that breathe the free spirit of the new age of the Renaissance. Dürer adapted the figure of Hercules from Pollaiuolo's The Rape of Deianira for a painting of Hercules and the Birds of Stymphalis (Germanisches Nationalmuseum, Nuremberg). A purely mythological painting in the Renaissance tradition, the Hercules is exceptional among Dürer's works. The centre panel from the Dresden Altarpiece, which Dürer painted in about 1498, is stylistically similar to the Hercules and betrays influences of Mantegna. In most of Dürer's free adaptations the additional influence of the more lyrical, older painter Giovanni Bellini, with whom Dürer had become acquainted in Venice, can be seen. The most striking painting illustrating Dürer's growth toward the Renaissance spirit is a self-portrait, painted in 1498 (Prado, Madrid). Here Dürer sought to convey, in the representation of his own person, the aristocratic ideal of the Renaissance. He liked the way he looked as a handsome, fashionably attired young man, confronting life rather conceitedly. In place of the conventional, neutral, monochromatic background, he depicts an interior, with a window opening on the right. Through the window can be seen a tiny landscape of mountains and a distant sea, a detail that is distinctly reminiscent of contemporary Venetian and Florentine paintings. The focus on his own figure in the interior distinguishes his world from the vast perspective of the distant scene, another world to which the artist feels himself linked. Italian influences were slower to take hold in Dürer's graphics than in his drawings and paintings. Strong late Gothic elements dominate the visionary woodcuts of his Apocalypse series (the Revelation of St John), published in 1498. The woodcuts in this series display emphatic expression, rich emotion, and crowded, frequently overcrowded, compositions. The same tradition influences the earliest woodcuts of Dürer's Large Passion series, also from about 1498. Nevertheless, the fact that Dürer was adopting a more modern conception, a conception inspired by classicism and humanism, is indicative of his basically Italian orientation. The woodcuts Samson and the Lion (c. 1498) and Hercules and many prints from the woodcut series The Life of the Virgin (c. 1500-10) have a distinct Italian flavour. Many of Dürer's copper engravings are in the same Italian mode. Some examples of them that may be cited are Fortune (c. 1502), The Four Witches (1497), The Sea Monster (c. 1498), Adam and Eve (1504), and The Large Horse (1505). Dürer's graphics eventually influenced the art of the Italian Renaissance that had originally inspired his own efforts. His painterly style, however, continued to vacillate between Gothic and Italian Renaissance until about 1500. Then his restless striving finally found definite direction. He seems clearly to be on firm ground in the penetrating half-length portraits of Oswolt Krel (Alte Pinakothek, Munich), in the portraits of three members of the aristocratic Tucher family of Nuremberg - all dated 1499 - and in the Portrait of a Young Man of 1500 (Alte Pinakothek). In 1500 Dürer painted another self-portrait (Alte Pinakothek, Munich) that is a flattering, Christlike portrayal. During this period of consolidation in Dürer's style, the Italian elements of his art were strengthened by his contact with Jacopo de' Barbari, a minor Venetian painter and graphic artist who was seeking a geometric solution to the rendering of human proportions; it is perhaps due to his influence that Dürer began, around 1500, to grapple with the problem of human proportions in true Renaissance fashion. Initially, the most concentrated result of his efforts was the great engraving Adam and Eve (1504) in which he sought to bring the mystery of human beauty to an intellectually calculated ideal form. In all aspects Dürer's art was becoming strongly classical. One of his most significant classical endeavours is his painting Altar of the Three Kings (1504), which was executed with the help of pupils. Although the composition, with its five separate pictures, has an Italian character, Dürer's intellect and imagination went beyond direct dependence on Italian art. From this maturity of style comes the bold, natural, relaxed conception of the centre panel, The Adoration of the Magi (Uffizi), and the ingenious and unconventional realism of the side panels, once believed to belong to this altarpiece, one of which depicts the Drummer and Piper and the other Job and His Wife (Wallraf-Richartz-Museum, Cologne). However, the side panels belong to the Jabach altarpiece, the cenral panel of which is lost. In the autumn of 1505, Dürer made a second journey to Italy, where he remained until the winter of 1507. Once again he spent most of his time in Venice. Of the Venetian artists, Dürer now most admired Giovanni Bellini, the leading master of Venetian early Renaissance painting, who, in his later works, completed the transition to the High Renaissance. Dürer's pictures of men and women from this Venetian period reflect the sweet, soft portrait types especially favoured by Bellini. One of Dürer's most impressive small paintings of this period, a compressed half-length composition of the Young Jesus with the Doctors of 1506, harks back to Bellini's free adaptation of Mantegna's Presentation in the Temple. Dürer's work is a virtuoso performance that shows mastery and close attention to detail. In the painting the inscription on the scrap of paper out of the book held by the old man in the foreground reads, ""Opus quinque dierum"" (""the work of five days""). Dürer thus must have executed this painstaking display of artistry, which required detailed drawings, in no more than five days. Of even greater artistic merit than this quickly executed work are the half-length portraits of young men and women painted between 1505 and 1507, which seem to be entirely in the style of Bellini. In these paintings there is a flexibility of the subject, combined with a warmth and liveliness of expression and a genuinely artistic technique, that Dürer otherwise rarely attained. In 1506, in Venice, Dürer completed his great altarpiece The Feast of the Rose Garlands for the funeral chapel of the Germans in the church of St Bartholomew. Later that same year Dürer made a brief visit to Bologna before returning to Venice for a final three months. The extent to which Dürer considered Italy to be his artistic and personal home is revealed by the frequently quoted words found in his last letter from Venice (dated October 1506) to Willibald Pirckheimer, his long-time humanist friend, anticipating his imminent return to Germany: ""O, how cold I will be away from the sun; here I am a gentleman, at home a parasite."" By February 1507 at the latest, Dürer was back in Nuremberg, where two years later he acquired an impressive house (which still stands and is preserved as a museum). It is clear that the artistic impressions gained from his Italian trips continued to influence Dürer to employ classical principles in creating largely original compositions. Among the paintings belonging to the period after his second return from Italy are Martyrdom of the Ten Thousand (1508) and Adoration of the Trinity (1511), which are both crowd scenes. Drawings from this period recall Mantegna and betray Dürer's striving for classical perfection of form through sweeping lines of firmly modeled and simple drapery. Even greater simplicity and grandeur characterize the diptych of Adam and Eve (1507; Prado), in which the two figures stand calmly in relaxed classical poses against dark, almost bare, backgrounds. Between 1507 and 1513 Dürer completed a Passion series in copperplate engravings, and between 1509 and 1511 he produced the Small Passion in woodcuts. Both of these works are characterized by their tendency toward spaciousness and serenity. During 1513 and 1514 Dürer created the greatest of his copperplate engravings: the Knight, Death and Devil, St Jerome in His Study, and Melencolia I - all of approximately the same size. The extensive, complex, and often contradictory literature concerning these three engravings deals largely with their enigmatic, allusive, iconographic details. Although repeatedly contested, it probably must be accepted that the engravings were intended to be interpreted together. There is general agreement, however, that Dürer, in these three master engravings, wished to raise his artistic intensity to the highest level, which he succeeded in doing. Finished form and richness of conception and mood merge into a whole of classical perfection. To the same period belongs Dürer's most expressive portrait drawing - one of his mother. While in Nuremberg in 1512, the Holy Roman emperor Maximilian I enlisted Dürer into his service, and Dürer continued to work mainly for the emperor until 1519. He collaborated with several of the greatest German artists of the day on a set of marginal drawings for the emperor's prayer book. He also completed a number of etchings in iron (between 1515 and 1518) that demonstrate his mastery of the medium and his freedom of imagination. In contrast to these pleasing improvisations are the monumental woodcuts, overloaded with panegyrics, made for Maximilian. In these somewhat stupendous, ornate woodcuts, Dürer had to strain to adapt his creative imagination to his client's mentality, which was foreign to him. Besides a number of formal show pieces - a painting entitled Lucretia (1518; Alte Pinakothek), and two portraits of the emperor (c. 1519) - during this decade Dürer produced a number of more informal paintings of considerably greater charm. He also traveled. In the fall of 1517 he stayed in Bamberg. In the summer of 1518 he went to Augsburg where he met Martin Luther, who had in the previous year circulated his Ninety-five Theses denouncing the sale of papal indulgences. Dürer later became a devoted follower of Luther. Dürer had achieved an international reputation as an artist by 1515, when he exchanged works with the illustrious High Renaissance painter Raphael. In July 1520 Dürer embarked with his wife on a journey through the Netherlands. In Aachen, at the October 23 coronation of the emperor Charles V, successor to Maximilian I (who had died in 1519), Dürer met and presented several etchings to the mystical and dramatic Matthias Grünewald, who stood second only to Dürer in contemporary German art. Dürer returned to Antwerp by way of Nijmegen and Cologne, remaining there until the summer of 1521. He had maintained close relations with the leaders of the Netherlands school of painting. In December 1520 Dürer visited Zeeland and in April 1521 traveled to Bruges and Ghent, where he saw the works of the 15th-century Flemish masters Jan and Hubert van Eyck, Rogier van der Weyden, and Hugo van der Goes, as well as the Michelangelo Madonna. Dürer's sketchbook of the Netherlands journey contains immensely detailed and realistic drawings. Some paintings that were created either during the journey or about the same time seem spiritually akin to the Netherlands school - for example, the St Anne with the Virgin and Child (Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York City), a half-length picture of St Jerome (1521; Museu Nacional de Arte Antiga, Lisbon), and the small portrait of Bernhard von Resten, previously Bernard van Orley (Gemäldegalerie, Dresden). By July, the travelers were back in Nuremberg, but Dürer's health had started to decline. He devoted his remaining years mostly to theoretical and scientific writings and illustrations, although several well-known character portraits and some important portrait engravings and woodcuts also date from this period. One of Dürer's greatest paintings, the so-called Four Holy Men (St John, St Peter, St Paul, and St Mark), was done in 1526. This work marks his final and certainly highest achievement as a painter. His delight in his own virtuosity no longer stifled the ideal of a spaciousness that is simple, yet deeply expressive. Dürer died in 1528 and was buried in the churchyard of Johanniskirchhof in Nuremberg. That he was one of his country's most influential artists is manifest in the impressive number of pupils and imitators that he had. Even Dutch and Italian artists did not disdain to imitate Dürer's graphics occasionally. The extent to which Dürer was internationally celebrated is apparent in the literary testimony of the Florentine artist Giorgio Vasari (1511-74), in whose Lives of the Most Eminent Italian Architects, Painters and Sculptors, the importance of Albrecht Dürer, the ""truly great painter and creator of the most beautiful copper engravings,"" is repeatedly stressed. Like most notable Italian artists, Dürer probably felt himself to be an ""artist-prince,"" and his self-portraits seem incontestably to show a man sure of his own genius. "

40977,Andrea di Lione,1610,1685,"Andrea di Lione (Leone), Italian painter. An eclectic and varied artist, he painted scenes from the Old and New Testaments, Roman history and mythology as well as still-lifes. He studied in Naples with the late Mannerist artist Belisario Corenzio (active 1590-1646), with whom he collaborated on frescoes of battle scenes for the Palazzo Reale in Naples (in situ). Then, attracted by the battle paintings of Aniello Falcone, he entered Falcone's studio, and his red chalk studies of the nude (e.g. Male Nude, Museum of Art, Philadelphia) and of parts of the body reflect the rigorous academic training that he received there. He became known as a painter of battles himself, and his works in this genre include two signed paintings, the Battle between the Hebrews and the Amalekites and the Combat between David and Goliath (both Naples, Capodimonte), and the signed and dated Battle against the Turks (1641; Paris, Louvre). In these works Lione moved away from the rather static compositions of Falcone and created more dramatic scenes, with richer colour and looser brushwork. Between 1637 and 1644 he was patronized by Ramiro Nuñez de Guzman, Duque de Medina de las Torres (Viceroy of Naples between 1637 and 1644), who commissioned works from him and from other Neapolitan painters to decorate the palace of the Buen Retiro, just outside Madrid; Lione's contributions included the Elephants in a Roman Circus (Madrid, Prado).

41235,Jan Victors,1619,1676,"Dutch painter, one of Rembrandt's lesser known pupils, who joined Rembrandt's studio around 1635. He was far from being a genius and his life was a hard one. He tried to make a living by giving nurcing assistance to families stricken by the plague, and he died during a voyage to the East Indies where he was hoping to retrieve his fortunes. His style, compared with that of his contemporaries, was coarse, vulgar and declamatory. He based his genre paintings on stories from the Bible, and he also painted humorous conversation pieces."
20726,Karel van der Pluym,1625,1672,"Dutch painter, draughtsman and etcher. He is best known as a second cousin and pupil of Rembrandt. His father, master leadsmith and slater in Leiden, was married to Cornelia van Suytbroek, Rembrandt's cousin. Van der Pluym probably began his apprenticeship with Rembrandt when he was about 20. Although this is undocumented, it is likely, considering both the family relation and his Rembrandtesque style of painting. In 1648 he was a member of the newly formed Leiden Guild of St Luke; following his marriage on 30 December 1651, he became a master of the Guild, and Dean in 1654-55. He also held other public offices in Leiden, which could indicate that he saw painting only as a side-line and could also explain why his oeuvre is so limited. In 1662 he drew up a will and testament bequeathing 3000 guilders on his death to Rembrandt's son, Titus; in 1665 he was made Titus's legal guardian in connection with a lawsuit over Titus's inheritance. From 1664 he was a member of the Council of Forty in Leiden, during which time it is presumed that he did no further painting. A number of paintings formerly attributed to Rembrandt, including such famous works as Saul and David and The Man in a Golden Helmet, seem to form a stylistically distinct group that was executed by another hand. Although the author of these canvases cannot be established with certainty, several of them have striking affinities in handling and subject matter with the work of Rembrandt's cousin and pupil, Karel van der Pluym.

He was the most important German animal painter of the 17th century; his realistic views of cattle, goats and sheep in the gentle sunshine of southern landscapes were much copied in Germany and Holland until the early 19th century. Philipp Peter Roos was his son. His family left their home in the Palatinate c. 1637, fleeing the Thirty Years War, and moved to Amsterdam c. 1640. There, Roos trained (1647-51) in history painting with Guilliam Dujardin (1597-after 1647), in landscape with Cornelis de Bie (c. 1621-1664) and in portraiture with Barent Graat (1628-1709). However, the younger Italian-inspired landscape painters Nicolaes Berchem and Karel Dujardin were to prove more influential on Roos's development of the pastoral idyll. He left Amsterdam in 1651-52; in 1653 he was working in Mainz, and from 1654 to 1659 he was employed at the court of Landgrave Ernest of Hesse in Rheinfels, where he painted a portrait of A Prince (1654, Kurpfälzisches Museum, Heidelberg), religious scenes (1655; destroyed) for the castle chapel and the first pastoral idylls. After 1659 Roos painted further portraits in the Palatinate and Mainz, before becoming court painter in 1664 to Charles Ludwig, Elector of the Palatinate, in Heidelberg. Because of unsatisfactory working conditions there he moved to Frankfurt am Main in 1667, where he soon established himself. He died from injuries sustained when his house caught fire. "

40920,Marco Benefial,1684,1764,"Italian painter and draftsman. He was a nonconformist artzist who reacted against the popular late Baroque style and ennobled contemporary Roman painting with humanity and naturalism. In seeking to renew artists' study of nature and to return to the classical tradition of Annibale Carracci and Raphael, Benefial anticipated Neoclassicism. When one of his paintings was rejected for exhibition at the Pantheon in 1703, Benefial displayed it in a pharmacist's window. In 1720, when he protested Pope Clement XI's decree that only Accademia di San Luca members could teach drawing, the ruling got revoked. Benefial's 1718 papal commission for a Roman church won him the title of Cavaliere. His paintings displayed tangible human figures, complex treatment of space, and warm, luminous colors. Along with frescoes and altarpieces, he painted numerous portraits. Because he partnered with inferior artists who then received credit, his paintings have often been misidentified. When Benefial was finally elected into the Accademia di San Luca at age fifty-seven, he denounced its members' ignorance and mediocrity; he was expelled in 1755. His work then developed an almost crude realism. "

He is noted for having created portraits and caricatures of the French nobility, courtiers, distinguished guests to noble households, and soldiers. He is also noted for having painted panoramas 'en transparence' for projection in a magic lantern. He was the designer of one of the earliest examples of the French landscape garden, Parc Monceau in Paris. Carmontelle came from a modest background - his father was a bootmaker. He studied drawing and geometry, and at the age of twenty three qualified for the title of engineer, and entered the service of the Duc de Chevreuse and the Duc de Luynes at the Château de Dampierre, where he taught drawing and mathematics to the children. In 1758, he entered the service of the Comte Pons de Saint-Maurice, governor of the Duc de Chartres and commander of regiment of Orléans-dragons as a topographical engineer. In addition to his drawing duties, he wrote farces and tales. After 1763 he entered into the service of Louis Philippe I, Duke of Orléans as a lecteur, responsible for providing theatrical performances for the family. He wrote and directed plays, decorated the scenery and made the costumes. In this way he invented a new genre of play, the 'proverbe dramatique', a scene of light comedy designed to be a point of departure for a theatrical improvisation. He also wrote plays for the famous ballerina, Marie-Madeleine Guimard for performance at the private theater of her residence, Pantin. In addition to his work in the theater, he was a talented artist, who made portraits in pen and watercolour in less than two hours of notable people that he met. The most famous of his drawings is that of the infant Mozart playing the clavier. Although the attribution is in dispute, he is traditionally assumed to be the author of an important body of art criticism, written in response to the Salons held between 1779 and 1789 and published anonymously.

In Florence, he responded particularly to the work of Bernardo Daddi. No signed or dated works exist from his Florentine period. He had returned to Fabriano in 1348, and in 1354 he seems to have collaborated with Puccio di Simone on an altarpiece for Sant'Antonio Abate fuori Porta Pisana (National Gallery of Art, Washington).

53025,Félicie de Fauveau,1799,1886,"French sculptor. She moved to France at the peak of the Restoration, after having spent her childhood in Florence. In Paris, she studied painting and sculpture and cultivated an interest in archeology and ancient symbolism, establishing a studio in Paris from 1826 to 1830 which was frequented by artists such as Paul Delaroche and Ary Scheffer. After her participation at the Paris Salon in 1827, De Fauveau received ample acclaim. One of the statues she presented at the event, Queen Christine of Sweden Refusing to Spare the Life of Her Equerry Monaldeschi, was awarded the gold medal, which the artist received from King Charles X, who looked to De Fauveau to promote the ideals of the Restoration. In Paris, she subsequently received multiple commissions including bronze doors destined for the Louvre, a project that failed to reach fulfilment. A dedicated Legitimist, who supported the return of the Bourbon king to France after the fall of Napoleon, De Fauveau was supported by Marie Caroline, Duchess of Berry. Both women organized failed resistance efforts in the Vandée region. De Fauveau hoped the crown would be captured by Marie Caroline's under-aged son, the Count of Chambord. After two squelched uprisings in the early 1830s and six months in prison, De Fauveau joined her mother in Florence in 1834, where she vowed to remain in voluntary exile until the Count of Chambord was crowned king of France, a hope that never materialized. During her time in Florence, De Fauveau cultivated many friendships with artistic and literary personalities. She was welcomed to the Grand Duchy by neoclassic Florentine sculptor Lorenzo Bartolini, who is thought to have trained her. She established an atelier which became a point of interest for international travelers on the Grand Tour. De Fauveau's works were coveted by the city's Russian ex-pats including Anatole Demidoff; the artist received multiple commissions from the industrialist. The Tsar Nicolas I purchased various works from the artist. De Fauveau was inspired by literary, political and religious themes. She was particularly interested in Monarchism and emulated medieval styles to support this political system in her art work. She was also known for including Christian symbolism in her work. A representative of the troubadour style, De Fauveau's Florentine works include an ornate Neo-Gothic holy water font at the Pitti Palace and the monumental tombs of Sir Charles Lyon Herbert and Lady Harriet Frances Pellew, at the English Cemetery in Piazzale Donatello.

66691,Jan van der Heyden,1637,1712,"Dutch painter, active in Amsterdam. He painted some landscapes and still-lifes, but is celebrated as one of the greatest of all townscape painters. His views of towns are done with loving attention to detail, but the harmonious colours and sunny light of his elegantly composed pictures prevent the precise way he rendered foliage, bricks, and architectural detail from appearing dull or dry. In spite of the seemingly objective nature of his work, van der Heyden often took liberties with topographical accuracy and he also painted 'capricci'. Painting was only a part of his activity. for he was also involved in civic administration in Amsterdam. The fire hose is said to have been his invention and it is included in his Brandspuiten-boek ('Fire Engine Book'), a volume about fire-fighting equipment, illustrated with his own engravings, that he published in 1690.

40465,Canaletto,1697,1768,"Giovanni Antonio Canal, Venetian painter, the son of Bernardo Canal, a well-known scenery painter at the time. 'Canaletto' - or small canal - as he was soon called, received his training in the studio of his father and his brother, with whom he continued to collaborate for several years. He became the most famous view-painter of the 18th century. He began his career as a theatrical scene painter (his father's profession), but he turned to topography during a visit to Rome in 1719-20, when he was influenced by the work of Giovanni Paolo Pannini. In Rome, in his own words, 'irritated by the immodesty of the playwrights, [he] formally foreswore the theatre,' to devote himself entirely to painting al naturale (from nature). It is not entirely clear what inspired him to this, but it was most likely his acquaintance with the work, and possibly also the person, of Caspar van Wittel. By 1723 he was painting picturesque views of Venice, marked by strong contrasts of light and shade and free handling, this phase of his work culminating in the splendid Stone Mason's Yard (c. 1730, National Gallery, London,). Meanwhile, partly under the influence of Luca Carlevaris, and largely in rivalry with him, Canaletto began to turn out views which were more topographically accurate, set in a higher key and with smoother, more precise handling - characteristics that mark most of his later work. At the same time he began painting the ceremonial and festival subjects which ultimately formed an important part of his work. His patrons were chiefly English collectors, for whom he sometimes produced series of views in uniform size. Conspicuous among them was Joseph Smith, a merchant, appointed British Consul in Venice in 1744. It was perhaps at his instance that Canaletto enlarged his repertory in the 1740s to include subjects from the Venetian mainland and from Rome (probably based on drawings made during his visit as a young man), and by producing numerous capricci. He also gave increased attention to the graphic arts, making a remarkable series of etchings, and many drawings in pen, and pen and wash, as independent works of art and not as preparation for paintings. Meanwhile, in his painting there was an increase in an already well-established tendency to become stylized and mechanical in handling. He often used the camera obscura as an aid to composition. In 1746 he went to England, evidently at the suggestion of Jacopo Amigoni (the War of the Austrian Succession drastically curtailed foreign travel, and Canaletto's tourist trade in Venice had dried up). For a time he was very successful painting views of London and of various country houses. Subsequently, his work became increasingly lifeless and mannered, so much so that rumours were put about, probably by rivals, that he was not in fact the famous Canaletto but an impostor. In 1755 he returned to Venice and continued active for the remainder of his life. Legends of his having amassed a fortune in Venice are disproved by the official inventory of his estate on his death. Before this, Joseph Smith had sold the major part of his paintings to George III, thus bringing into the royal collection an unrivalled group of Canaletto's paintings and drawings. Canaletto was highly influential in Italy and elsewhere. His nephew Bernardo Bellotto took his style to Central Europe and his followers in England included William Marlow and Samuel Scott. "

He trained in Florence with Michele Tosini, whose studio he left c. 1556 to work for six years under Vasari on the redecoration of the Palazzo Vecchio, Florence; there he was apparently employed as a designer of tapestries. This was followed by two years of study in Rome. By 1563 he had returned to Florence, where he became a member of the newly founded Accademia del Disegno. Under the academy's auspices he collaborated in 1564 with his friend Mirabello Cavalori on a grisaille painting of Lorenzo de' Medici Receiving Michelangelo (untraced) for the catafalque of Michelangelo's funeral in S Lorenzo, Florence. For the academy's next major project, the decorations for Duke Francesco I de' Medici's wedding in 1565 to Joanna of Austria (1547-78), Macchietti contributed a monochrome painting of the Establishment of the Monastery of Monte Oliveto Maggiore (untraced) towards a festive ‘Arch of Religion'. He participated in the Vasari-directed decoration of the Studiolo of Francesco I with two canvases, one relating a Jason and Medea (1570) and the other a Baths at Pozzuoli (1572). He also painted an altarpiece on the Martyrdom of Saint Lawrence for Santa Maria Novella. In 1577, he completed a Gloria di San Lorenzo for Empoli Cathedral. He traveled to Rome and spent two years in Spain (1587-1589). No works are recorded from these travels. "

36522,Robert Salmon,1775,1853,"American painter of English origin. Having trained and painted in England and Scotland, he moved to Boston in 1828, painting in a 'little hut' near the wharves of South Boston. Reportedly an eccentric, he became a successful painter of marine views, adopting a range of different scales, including small wooden panels, larger canvases and theatre backdrops. Moonlight Coastal Scene (1836; St Louis, Art Museum) is typical of his works on panel, and it demonstrates his use of light to silhouette form. There are no extant examples of the panoramic views done as backdrops; his canvases such as Wharves of Boston (1829; Boston, Old State House) and View of Charlestown (1833; Annapolis, US Naval Academy Museum) are full of carefully delineated figures, minute and accurate details of the ships and their rigging, and, most importantly, large expanses of sky dominated by strong light. Salmon's portrayal of light-filled water and sky, increasingly luminous in the late 1830s and early 1840s, has caused him to be considered by some as the father of Luminism. He used a low viewpoint and contrasted a distant shoreline and small-scale figures in the foreground in a manner that prefigured the work of Fitz Hugh Lane and Martin Johnson Heade, both of whom were influenced by Salmon's manipulation of scale, light and subject-matter. It appears that he returned to England before his death. "

33370,Francesco Albani,1578,1660,"Albani studied in Bologna with the Mannerist Denijs Calvaert before joining the Carracci Academy where he was an enthusiastic pupil. Like so many other artists from Bologna, he moved to Rome to study classical art which he then applied with zeal to his own work. Albani's classicism can be seen in the altarpieces he painted after returning to Bologna. Among them is The Baptism of Christ now in the Bologna Pinacoteca Nazionale. His love of classical antiquity is still more evident in the cycles he painted on mythological subjects, a genre of painting he practically established. He used mythology in Dance of the Amorini or the allegorical tradition (elements, seasons) as the pretext to paint smiling idylls to which he added nymphs, goddesses, and happy little putti all set against luminous ideal landscapes. In this way he created an appetite for light-hearted, pleasant works which lasted throughout the seventeenth century. It did, however, tend at times to decline into insipidity. His favourite format for this type of composition was the tondo or oval. "

Travels from 1628 to 1638 took him to Constantinople, Tunis and several European countries. In Rome from 1638 to 1640, he copied the frescoes of Michelangelo and Raphael, studied the works of the Carracci, Pietro da Cortona and Guido Reni, and also came under the prevailing influence of Gianlorenzo Bernini. His earliest known work, the Rape of the Sabines (1641; Siena, Pinacoteca Nazionale), richly reflects this experience of Rome. On his return journey to Venice (c. 1643) he stopped in Bologna and may have seen works by Emilian artists, from Correggio to Reni, in Parma. Liberi was one of the most interesting Venetian artists of the seventeenth century. His nickname was ""Il Libertino,"" because of his gracefully erotic work. His frescoes and major works decorate numerous palaces and churches in Venice (the Doge's Palace, Santa Maria della Salute, etc.), and his oils are in the Hermitage, the British Museum, the Queen's collection in Hampton Court, and the Ringling Museum of Art in Sarasota.

The son of a decorative sculptor, he entered the Ecole des Beaux-Arts, Paris, in 1824 as a pupil of Charles Dupaty (1771-1825), moving in 1825 to the studio of James Pradier. Ingres also took an interest in his education, and Etex's gratitude towards him and Pradier was later expressed in projects for monuments to them (that to Pradier not executed, that in bronze to Ingres erected Montauban, Promenade des Carmes, 1868-71). He is best known as a sculptor. Among his works are two large groups, Resistance and Peace, on the Arc de Triomphe de l'Étoile, Paris; Géricault's tomb; and the monument to Ingres at Montauban. "
40577,John Flaxman,1755,1826,"English sculptor, draughtsman, and designer, an outstanding figure of the Neoclassical movement. He was the son of a moulder of plaster figures, and after studying at the Royal Academy School (where he met his life-long friend Blake) he worked for the potter Josiah Wedgwood from 1775 to 1787. The designs he produced for Wedgwood not only strengthened his interest in antique art but also developed the innate sensitivity to line that was his greatest gift. At the same time he gradually built up a practice as a sculptor. In 1787 he went to Rome to direct the Wedgwood studio and stayed for seven years. While there he drew his illustrations, much influenced by Greek vase painting, to the Iliad and the Odyssey, engraved and published in Rome in 1793, followed by illustrations to Aeschylus (1795) and Dante (1802). These engravings, which are of exceptional purity of outline, were republished in several editions, and won him international fame. His later illustrations to Hesiod (1817) were engraved by Blake. He returned to England in 1794 with a well-established reputation and immediately became a busy sculptor. His monument to the poet William Collins (Chichester Cathedral, 1795) and the more important one to Lord Mansfield (Westminster Abbey, 1795-1801) were commissioned while he was in Rome. His enormous practice as a maker of monuments included large groups with freestanding figures (Lord Nelson, St Paul's Cathedral, 1809), but his most characteristic work appears in simpler and smaller monuments, sometimes cut in low relief. In these his great gift for linear design was given full play. Flaxman was appointed the first Professor of Sculpture at the Royal Academy in 1810 and his reputation among Neoclassical sculptors was exceeded only by those of Canova and possibly Thorvaldsen. He was one of the first English artists to be famous outside his own country, although his reputation and influence were based principally on engravings after his drawings rather than his sculpture. University College London has a large collection of Flaxman's drawings and models, and examples of his monuments can be seen in churches throughout England. "

64182,Lilla Cabot Perry,1848,1933,"Lilla Cabot Perry (née Lilla Cabot), American painter, one of the first American artists to embrace Impressionism during the late 19th century. Better known for her artwork, she also wrote four volumes of poetry. Although she had no formal art training until age 36, Lilla Cabot Perry became a professional painter and a devotee of French Impressionism with a formidable body of work. She developed a solid reputation during her lifetime as a painter, helping to promote Impressionism in the U.S. and Japan. In 1874, she married Thomas Sergeant Perry, a Harvard alumnus scholar and linguist, and added his name. After marrying, Perry and her family traveled widely, living in Paris from 1887 to 1889, where Lilla studied painting. She also trained in Munich and copied old-master paintings in Italy, England, and Spain. It was in 1889, when she was 41 years old, that Perry saw her first Impressionist painting (a work by Claude Monet). Perry sought out the artist and became his close friend. For nine summers the Perrys rented a house at Giverny, near Monet's, and although he never took pupils, he often advised Perry on her art. Between 1898 and 1901, the family resided in Japan. This experience gave Perry a rare opportunity to study the sources of Impressionism notably Japanese fabrics and prints in depth. There, she produced some 80 paintings; she continued to be prolific throughout her life. Perry exhibited her work at the Paris Salon and the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago in 1893, and won medals for her paintings at important exhibitions in Boston, St. Louis, and San Francisco. She was active in numerous arts organizations and published four well-received volumes of verse. "

He first trained with his brother and then matriculated in the Accademia del Disegno in 1631. He worked in Rome c. 1635-36, studying ancient and modern works and also as a member of Pietro da Cortona's workshop. He then returned to Florence and collaborated over the next two decades with his elder brother. He often worked for the Medici court, particularly for Lorenzo de' Medici, for whom he painted the Adoration of Niobe and Venus, Mercury and Cupid (1637-38; Florence, Uffizi), and later for the Medici tapestry factory (1662-63). Besides working in fresco and making cartoons for tapestries, he produced numerous paintings on literary and religious themes, for example the signed and dated SS Carlo Borromeo and Andrea Zoerandro (1657; Arezzo, Santa Maria in Gradi) and SS Bernardino of Siena and Giovanni Capestrano Adoring the Name of Jesus (1667; Florence, Museo Ognissanti). His drawings are clearly influenced by his brother and by Pietro da Cortona. Those studies and copies from the Dandini studio collection inscribed V.D.v. are probably done by him. As with Cesare, his style became more animated and dramatic in later works. Pupils of Vincenzo included his nephew Pietro Dandini and Anton Domenico Gabbiani. Vincenzo emerges as a significant artistic personality, displaying at times a great truth to nature and sense of humanity. "

He later worked for Rudolf II in Prague, where he died. He was a typical representative of late Mannerism, using numerous nude figures in unlikely attitudes to fill his compositions, which derive ultimately from Correggio and Parmigianino. The engravings of Goltzius made his works very widely known. In Haarlem, besides Goltzius, he influenced Cornelisz. and van Mander, and in Utrecht Wtewael. He is well represented in the Vienna Gallery, but there are other examples in Antwerp, Brussels, Chicago, Cleveland Ohio, London (NG), Munich, Paris and elsewhere. "

He was not only one of the most talented of Rembrandt's pupils, but also one of his most devoted followers, for he was the only Dutch artist to continue working in his style into the 18th century. His religious paintings, in particular, with their imaginative boldness and preference for oriental types, are very much in the master's spirit, although de Gelder often used colors - such as lilac and lemon yellow - that were untypical of Rembrandt, and his palette was in general lighter. One of his best-known works, Jacob's Dream (Dulwich College Picture Gallery, London), was long attributed to Rembrandt."

Chase was a prolific painter of portraits, interiors, still-lifes and landscapes, famed for establishing the fresh colour and bravura technique used in much early 20th-century American painting. Proficient in many media, he is best known for his spirited portraits and still-lifes in oil. His Carmencita, Lady in Black, and portrait of Whistler (all: Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York) and My Daughter Alice (Cleveland Museum of Art) are characteristic. Chase is considered one of the most important American Impressionists, his work being close in style to that of the early French Impressionists. He was the most important American teacher of his time. He was president of the Society of American Artists for 10 years and a member of the National Academy of Design. "

The son of Mary Hoad and James Field Stanfield, an Irish actor and author, he was apprenticed to a heraldic coach painter at the age of 12, but in 1808 he abandoned this and went to sea in a collier. In 1812 he was press-ganged and spent two years on HMS Namur, the guard-ship at Sheerness. After being discharged as the result of an injury in 1814, he joined the merchant navy, sailing to China in the Indiaman Warley in 1815. Soon after his return in 1816 he missed his ship and became a scene painter, first at the Royalty Theatre, Stepney, and then at the Royal Coburg, Lambeth. There he was later joined by David Roberts, who became a lifelong friend, and in 1822 both men were employed as scene painters at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane. During the next 12 years Stanfield established himself as the most talented scene painter of his day, causing a sensation with some of his huge moving dioramas such as the scenes of Venice in the pantomime Harlequin and Little Thumb (1831). Meanwhile he was building an equally impressive reputation as an easel painter. He first exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1820 and continued to exhibit there regularly until his death. He was elected ARA in 1832 and RA in 1835. He was a founder-member of the Society of British Artists and became its president in 1829. Between 1824 and 1851 he traveled extensively throughout Europe (Italy, Holland, France, Spain). Stanfield was regarded as the greatest British marine artist of his day. His most impressive work is the vast Battle of Trafalgar (1836; London, United Services Club). In addition to his oil paintings, Stanfield produced many watercolours, the best of which have the spontaneity of watercolours by Bonington, an artist he much admired. He also furnished illustrations for several books. In 1847 he and his family moved into the Green-Hill, a large house in Hampstead. It became a meeting-place for writers and artists including William Makepeace Thackeray, Edwin Henry Landseer, C. R. Leslie and Charles Dickens, a devoted friend. Stanfield also contributed illustrations to Dickens's Christmas books and designed sets for his amateur theatricals. "

During his long career he painted a great variety of subjects: portraits, luminous salt marsh scenes, seascapes (often with thunder storms), tropical landscapes, hummingbird and orchid pictures, and floral still-lifes. Heade is associated with American luminism, particularly in his uniquely lit canvases of coming thunderstorms. He painted dramatic seascapes and landscapes of New England. In his nature studies, scientifically exact birds and plants are set against poetic backgrounds in eerie colours. His notable paintings include Orchids and Hummingbirds (Detroit Instute of Arts) and Approaching Storm: Beach near Newport (Museum of Fine Arts, Boston). "

26935,Gerrit van Honthorst,1592,1656,"Dutch painter (byname Gherardo della Notte), a leading member of the Utrecht school influenced by the Italian painter Caravaggio. He was born in Utrecht as the son of a textile painter. His younger brother Willem also became a painter. Van Honthorst was apprenticed to Abraham Bloemaert, the most celebrated master in Utrecht. He went to Italy around 1610-1615, when Caravaggio's influence there was at its height. In Italy, Van Honthorst acquired the nickname Gherardo delle Notti, because his figures are often portrayed in the darkness of night. He soon made a name for himself and received commissions from distinguished patrons such as Vincenzo Giustiniani and Cardinal Scipione Borghese.  Notable works of his Italian sojourn include The Beheading of St John the Baptist (S. Maria delle Scala, Rome), Christ Before the High Priest (c. 1617, National Gallery, London), and the Supper Party (1620, Uffizi, Florence), all nocturnal scenes. In 1620, Van Honthorst returned to Utrecht and married Sophia Coopmans in the same year. In 1622, he joined the Guild of St Luke in Utrecht. He was appointed dean of the guild in 1625 and remained in office for many years. In 1627, he bought a large house and used part of it as his workshop. Van Honthorst was much sought after as a teacher, and at one stage he was said to have approximately twenty-five pupils - roughly the same number as Rubens who, incidentally, paid a visit to his studio in 1627. Van Honthorst's fame soon spread and in 1628 he was invited to work in London at the court of King Charles I. Although he returned to Utrecht before the year was out, he kept in touch with his acquaintances in England. Van Honthorst was also sought after in The Hague, where he received commissions from members of the House of Orange. He painted several portraits of Frederick Hendrik and Amalia van Solms, and worked on the decoration of their palaces. In connection with these projects in The Hague Van Honthorst joined the local painters' guild in 1637. He was invited to paint a portrait of the French Queen Maria de Medici on the occasion other visit to the city, and subsequently received commissions from the King of Denmark and the Elector Palatine of Brandenburg. Honthorst accepted commissions for decorative cycles and painted at least one illusionistic ceiling, however, his most significant contribution to Dutch painting was his joint leadership, with Terbrugghen, of the Utrecht followers of Caravaggio. Rembrandt's use of Caravaggesque devices in his early works derives in large part from his knowledge of Honthorst's paintings. Honthorst's brother Willem van Honthorst (1594-1666), who was also an accomplished painter, sometimes worked with him. Although he was one of the painters selected to contribute work for the Oranjezaal in Huis ten Bosch, his clients gradually became aware of his shortcomings. Van Honthorst's overwhelming success had brought him tremendous wealth and he lived in the lap of luxury. But his reputation as an artist was tarnished. He died in Utrecht in 1656 and was buried in the Catharijnekerk. "

40464,Giulio Campi,1490,1572,"The Campi were a family of Italian painters in Cremona in the 16th century. In the north of Italy, where they had the splendid example of the Venetians and some knowledge of Flemish and German art, the contrasts of light and shade could express the Mannerist feeling perfectly, as in the work of the Campi at Cremona. The head of the family was Galeazzo Campi (1477-1536), a pupil of Boccaccio Boccaccini. His close contacts with Tommaso Aleni are assumed, owing to stylistic alliance. In his landscapes influences from Giovanni Bellini and Perugino can be observed. He was the father of Giulio, Antonio and Vincenzo. Giulio Campi worked chiefly in Cremona. His first altarpieces reveal ideas from Brescia and the Emilia. He collaborated with Camillo Boccaccino, later was influenced by Giulio Romano and Pordenone. Antonio Campi (Cavaliere Antonio) was the second son of Galeazzo. His initial works remain close to the style of his brother Giulio, and that of Camillo Boccaccino. His graphic works exhibit influences from Parmigianino and Emilian sculpture. In 1560 he abandoned collaboration with his brother Giulio and began to develop more independently. He had probably contacts with Peterzano in the last decade, whose Reformist style he approached. Vincenzo Campi trained under his brother Giulio. He painted mainly saints and portraits as well as genre-like still-lifes, like the two fruit and fishmongers' paintings at the Brera, Milan. Both show that he was influenced by Pieter Aertsen. Bernardino Campi (1522-1591) was not directly related to Galeazzo Campi or his sons. Nevertheless he was an assistant to Giulio Campi and was influenced by Giulio Romano. "

33799,Benedetto Buglioni,1461,1521,"Italian sculptor, part of a family of sculptors, active in Florence and elsewhere in Italy from the late 15th century to the 16th, particularly noted for works in glazed terracotta. He was the son of the sculptor Giovanni di Bernardo (1429/30-c. 1510) and possibly a pupil of Andrea Verrocchio. He probably worked with Andrea della Robbia, whose glazing techniques he learnt. In the early 1480s he opened his own shop, producing works in the style of della Robbia, often with compositions after Verrocchio, Antonio Rossellino or Benedetto da Maiano. His first documented work dates from 1484: a relief of the Descent into Limbo (untraced) for SS Annunziata in Florence. From 1487 to 1490 he and his brother Francesco (1462-1520) went to Perugia, where he executed for the cathedral the stone altar of the Holy Ring, of which only the busts of Isaiah and David are extant, and many works in glazed terracotta for the monastery of S Pietro dei Cassinesi, including a pulpit and a basin with Christ and the Samaritans (both in situ). Among works from the 1490s are: the glazed altarpiece of the Resurrection (1490; Pistoia, Museo Civico) for Pistoia Cathedral; a frieze (c. 1493; London, Victoria and Albert Museum) for the main chapel of S Chiara in Florence; an altarpiece of the Crucifixion (1490-95; Radicofani, S Pietro); and the lunette with St Mary of Egypt (Florence, Museo dell'Opera del Duomo). Also in this period he and his brother executed many projects for the sanctuary of S Cristina in Bolsena, rebuilt by order of Cardinal Giovanni de' Medici, notably the stone façade (1493-5), the effigy on the saint's tomb and an impressive tabernacle, the 'altar of St Christina'. The important decoration (1500) of the oratory of S Maria delle Grazie near Stia (Arezzo) was among many commissions from the Florentine prelate Leonardo Buonafede (c. 1450-1544). Buglioni was one of those appointed to decide the location of Michelangelo's David (Florence, Accademia) in 1504, probably the year he produced the glazed decoration (destroyed) of the Del Bianco Chapel in the Badia Fiorentina. From c. 1500 his workshop produced terracottas with naturalistic colourings, such as the Virgin with SS Jerome and Nicholas of Bari (1502; Amsterdam, Rijksmuseum) and the Virgin with SS John the Baptist and Anthony Abbot (S Casciano, near Florence, S Giovanni in Sugana). Probably c. 1510 he executed the Coronation of the Virgin over the portal of Ognissanti and the St Lucy Adored by Angels over the portal of S Lucia dei Magnoli (both Florence). His last documented work is the Virgin with Child and Four Saints, commissioned by Buonafede for S Michele at Badia Tedalda, Arezzo (in situ), for which he was paid in 1517. From 1510-20 he produced many polychrome altarpieces, for example the Nativity (Montaione, S Vivaldo) and the Assumption (Barga, S Elisabetta), the latest being the Virgin and Saints for S Miniato al Montanino near Figline (dated 1520; Florence, Museo Ospedale degli Innocenti).

41019,Richard Westall,1765,1836,"English painter and illustrator. He was apprenticed in 1799 to John Thompson, a heraldic engraver in London. The miniaturist John Alefounder (d. 1795) advised Westall to take up painting, and in 1784 he exhibited a portrait drawing (untraced) at the Royal Academy. He became a student at the Royal Academy Schools in 1785, an Associate of the Royal Academy (ARA) in 1792 and a Royal Academician (RA) in 1794. He exhibited over 300 works at the Royal Academy and 70 at the British Institution, including such large watercolours as Cassandra Prophesying the Fall of Troy (1796; Victoria and Albert Museum, London), which are painted in violent and sometimes excessive colours. Others, such as The Rosebud (1791; Yale Center of British Art, New Haven), tend towards a Rococo prettiness. Westall's principal expertise was book illustration. He was employed by John Boydell, Thomas Macklin and Robert Bowyer, and he illustrated Milton's poetical works (3 vols; London, 1794-97). He painted five pictures for Boydell's Shakespeare Gallery, including a Scene from Henry VIII (1790s; Folger Shakespeare Library, Washington). In 1814 he held a solo exhibition at his house in Upper Charlotte Street, London. His output was prolific, but unfortunate picture dealings led to poverty. The artist's son, William Westall (1781-1850), was a painter, engraver, and lithographer. "

It is probable that the young painter soon moved to Florence, where he studied the paintings of Jacques Courtois and copied 24 of his battle scenes. Later it is said that Simonini visited Rome. He certainly worked in Bologna, where he was documented as the 'painter of the most eminent Cardinal Ruffo, Papal ambassador in Bologna', a post the Cardinal held from August 1721 to August 1727. After a short stay in Florence, he settled in Venice, where he had the best of the English aristocracy among his clients. He was also the celebrated Marshal Schulenberg's official painter, and followed him on his military campaigns. Simonini participated in a number of Von der Schulenberg's military campaigns, thus explaining the large number of cavalry scenes that are attributed to him. His distinctive style, with its rapid brushwork and vivid use of colour, was formed under the influence of his Venetian contemporaries and, in particular, of the view-painter Marco Ricci. "

He was a pupil of Angelo Everardi (1647-1678, called il Fiamminghino or Fiammenghino). His paintings were generally seen as humorous or satirical, and often scabrous pieces, though some resemble the decorative conceits of Arcimboldo, while others suggest the nightmarish world of Hieronymus Bosch. He is also described as a genre painter of the Bambocciati. Bocchi's paintings were highly prized by Bergamesque collectors. "

41633,Giacinto Gimignani,1611,1681,"Painter and etcher, part of an Italian family of artists, son of Alessio Gimignani (1567-1651), a respected painter in his home town of Pistoia. Giacinto Gimignani painted altarpieces and frescoes, as well as producing etchings, but was best known for his classicist easel pictures of biblical and historical themes. He is traditionally said to have been trained by his father. From 1630 he is documented in Rome, and from 1632 he worked under the direction of Pietro da Cortona for the Barberini family. His first surviving work, also documented by drawings, is the frescoed lunette of the Rest on the Flight to Egypt (1632) in the chapel of the Palazzo Barberini, while his earliest signed and dated painting is the Adoration of the Magi (1634; Rome, Collezione Urbano Propaganda Fide, chapel). During the reign of the Barberini pope Urban VIII (reg 1623-44), he painted many pictures for the Barberini circle, among them a fresco of the Vision of Constantine in the ambulatory of the baptistery of S Giovanni in Laterano (in situ), under the direction of Andrea Sacchi. His early training with Cortona influenced his brilliant colour and painterly surfaces, yet he was also responsive to the more austere art of Domenichino and Sacchi, to the refined mythologies of Alessandro Turchi and to Nicolas Poussin and his French contemporaries in Rome. Gimignani developed an individual classicist style, and the intense colour and balanced compositions of his many easel paintings of biblical and Classical themes, such as Rachel Hiding the Idols (1640s; Florence, Galleria Corsini), are closest to Poussin. His works were popular with French patrons, among them François Annibal d'Estrées (1573-1670), who commissioned Rinaldo and Armida in the Enchanted Forest (1640; Bouxwiller, Musée de la Ville). With Giovanni Francesco Romanelli he played a decisive role in introducing the Roman Baroque style to France. In the 1640s Gimignani also began to produce etchings, as reproductions of his paintings and as book illustrations, such as those for F. Strada's De bello Belgico: Decades duae (Rome, 1647). In 1648 he assisted Cortona in the decoration of the Palazzo Pamphili, Rome. "

31862,Johann Liss,1592,1631,"Johann Liss (Lys), German painter, active mainly in Italy. He trained in the Netherlands (probably in Amsterdam, possibly with Goltzius) and visited Paris before moving to Italy c.1620. Venice seems to have been the main centre of his activity, but he also worked in Rome, and Caravaggesque influence is clearly seen in such vivid and strongly lit works as Judith and Holofernes. His work enjoyed considerable popularity in Venice (where there was a dearth of talented native painters at this time) and his Vision of St Jerome in the church of San Nicola da Tolentino was much copied. It shows the remarkably free brushwork and brilliant use of high-keyed colour that were the salient features of his style and which were influential on Venetian painting when its glory revived in the 18th century. It was formerly assumed that Liss, who ranks second only to Elsheimer as the most brilliant German painter of the 17th century, perished in the Venetian plague of 1629-30, but it is now known that he died in Verona in 1631.

Records of his activity cease after 1733, the year in which he received a commission for two candlesticks for the basilica of Sant'Antonio (il Santo) in Padua. He produced distinctive, small-scale sculptural groups, usually in bronze, sometimes in marble. These decorative pieces, purchased avidly by 18th-century Italians and tourists to Italy, made their way into various collections in Europe and North America. Typical of his bronze groups are the Allegory of Triumph (Art institute, Chicago) and America (Walters Art Gallery, Baltimore), both with several allegorical figures arranged in a boldly dynamic pyramid. The elongated, twisting figures are almost Mannerist in their proportions and assume difficult, seemingly weightless poses. Many of the works recall Giambologna's sculptures; indeed Bertos made a small-scale marble copy (Palazzo Reale, Turin) of Giambologna's Rape of the Sabine Women (Florence, Loggia dei Lanzi). All his pieces are virtuosic, no matter what the size or number of figures included, and display Bertos's knowledge both of the bronze statuettes of Renaissance craftsmen and of 15th-century German goldsmith's pieces.

Romanelli's graceful style was less energetic than Cortona's (he owed much to his first teacher Domenichino) and his restrained type of Baroque proved particularly popular and influential in France, where he worked 1645-7 and 1655-7. He introduced to Paris Cortona's characteristic manner of decoration, consisting of paintings combined with richly gilded stuccowork, and this was one of the sources for the great schemes of Lebrun at Versailles and elsewhere. Examples of Romanelli's work survive in the Bibliothéque Nationale (painted for Cardinal Mazarin) and (much altered) in the Salle des Saisons of the Louvre (painted for Anne of Austria, mother of Louis XIV).

22171,Philipp Peter Roos,1655,1706,"German painter, called Rosa da Tivoli, member of a family of painters and etchers of which five generations painted animals, landscapes and portraits from the 17th to the 19th century, working in Germany, the Netherlands, Italy and Austria. The founding father was Johann Heinrich Roos, whose pastoral idylls introduced a Baroque style of landscape and animal painting into Germany. Philipp Peter Roos was the son of Johann Heinrich. He went to Italy in 1677 on a bursary from the Landgrave of Hesse. In Rome he studied with Giacinto Brandi, whose daughter Maria Isabella he married in 1681, after adopting the Catholic faith. In 1684-05 he bought a house near Tivoli, which gave rise to his soubriquet 'Rosa da Tivoli'. From 1691 he seems to have lived mainly in Rome. Roos was a member of the Schildersbent, which gave him the nickname 'Mercurius' because of the speed with which he painted. Apart from a Self-portrait (c. 1695-1700; Florence, Uffizi), he painted exclusively domestic animals with their herdsmen in the Roman Campagna. The animals dominate the foreground, leaving only small glimpses through to landscapes set beneath louring skies. Roos applied his paint in impastos, rendering the coats, the stance and the movements of each species in a virtuoso manner. The light bodies of the animals seem to grow fascinatingly out of the darkness. In the 1680s Roos tended to depict small groups of animals - sheep, goats, often headed by a billy goat with twisting horns. The herders lie at the side dressed in coarse clothing, closely bound up with the animals. Far off, wildly precipitous valleys alternate with high cliff-faces lit by a yellow-brown light; the distant mountains are conveyed in tones of light blue. Altogether the pictures are characterized by a spectral, sombre, wild and daring boldness. "

They include reproductive as well as original prints, and his independence of vision makes him one of the most interesting interpreters of his time. His activity in this field began c. 1531, as is indicated by the date on the Raphaelesque St Cecilia. Parmigianino entrusted him with the copper engraving of his drawings, for example Mercury and Minerva. While in Rome c. 1544-47 Bonasone interpreted works including Michelangelo's Last Judgment and Raphael's Toilet of Psyche. He often combined the techniques of etching and engraving in the same print.

40560,Jules Dupré,1811,1889,"French painter, one of the chief members of the Barbizon school of landscape painters. If Corot stands for the lyric and Rousseau for the epic aspect of the poetry of nature, Dupré is the exponent of her tragic and dramatic aspects. Dupré exhibited first at the Salon in 1831, and three years later was awarded a second-class medal. In the same year he went to England, where he was deeply impressed by the genius of Constable. From him he learnt how to express movement in nature; and the district of Southampton and Plymouth, with its wide, unbroken expanses of water, sky and ground, gave him good opportunities for studying the tempestuous motion of storm-clouds and the movement of foliage driven by the wind. He received the cross of the Légion d'honneur in 1848. Dupré's colour is sonorous and resonant; the subjects for which he showed marked preference are dramatic sunset effects and stormy skies and seas. Late in life he changed his style and gained appreciably in largeness of handling and arrived at greater simplicity in his colour harmonies. Among his chief works are the Morning and Evening at the Louvre, and the early Crossing the Bridge in the Wallace Collection. A frequent and honoured exhibitor at the Salon, Dupré spent his last years at L'Isle-Adam, where some of his best work was done. "

He was one of the most important and productive Dutch portrait draughtsmen and engravers of the 17th century, despite his early death. He was probably a pupil of the Haarlem painter and engraver Pieter Soutman. In 1649-50 he made numerous portrait engravings for several print series published and supervised by Soutman. He was probably Soutman's principal collaborator during this period, although the quantity of prints produced suggests that he was not the only one. After 1650 Visscher apparently set up independently. In 1653 he joined the Haarlem Guild of St Luke, but he must have moved to Amsterdam shortly thereafter. In addition to portraits, he also did engravings of biblical scenes, genre scenes, landscapes, and animal studies. "

He attended the Kunstgewerbeschule in Dresden (1886-94), before moving to Munich, where he studied with Paul Hoecker (1854-1910) and Wilhelm von Diez (1839-1907), and drew caricatures for the journals Jugend and Simplicissimus, as a colleague of Olaf Gulbransson (1873-1958) and Thomas Theodor Heine. With Peter Behrens, Hermann Obrist, Bernhard Pankok, Richard Riemerschmid and others, Paul was a founder-member of the Vereinigte Werkstätten für Kunst im Handwerk in Munich, a group dedicated to the production of well-designed furniture and works of decorative art. Paul's early furniture designs, although aligned to Jugendstil in general concept, resisted the excessive curves and tentacles favoured by contemporary French and Belgian designers. Around 1904 Paul rejected Jugendstil in favour of a rectilinear, Neo-Biedermeier manner. His interiors for a hunting-room at the Exposition Universelle in Paris in 1900 and for a study at the World's Fair (Louisiana Purchase International Exposition) in St Louis in 1904 both won the Grand Prix award. In 1907 Paul was a founder-member of the Deutscher Werkbund and became Director of Education at the Kunstgewerbemuseum in Berlin. An exhibition of standardized furniture for mass production followed in 1908 in Berlin. In the same period, Paul designed interiors for several ships. The Haus Westend was constructed to his design in 1908-99, the first of several large houses that he was to build in Berlin over the next two decades. A clinic (c. 1912) in Pützchen, Bonn, three pavilions (1914) at the Deutscher Werkbundausstellung in Cologne and the Museum für Völkerkunde in Dahlem, Berlin, were his most significant commissions before World War I. In 1924 Paul was appointed Director of the Vereinigte Staatschulen für Freie und Angewandte Kunst (now the Hochschule der Künste), Berlin. In addition to many interiors, including those for the liner Bremen (1927), Paul designed a series of large villas in Berlin, in which the traditional features of the country houses in the Mark Brandenburg were combined with the large windows and accented horizontals favoured by the Modern Movement. Stripped of his teaching position as ‘politically undependable' in November 1933, Paul's activity was limited to small commissions for industrial concerns. In 1954 he was made an honorary member of the Bund Deutscher Architekten and in 1955 a member of the Akademie der Künste, West Berlin. "

He became a close friend of William Callow (1812-1908), with whom he made a number of sketching tours to the Normandy coast and Paris. He also travelled throughout the British Isles. Bentley never exhibited at the Royal Academy but showed 209 works at the Old Water-Colour Society between 1834 and 1854 and also at Suffolk Street.

37099,Gerbrand van den Eeckhout,1621,1674,"Dutch biblical, genre, and portrait painter, a gifted and favourite pupil of Rembrandt, to whom he remained a close friend. His usual style is based so closely on that of his master that many of his pictures have passed as works of Rembrandt himself. Eeckhout was one of the most successful of this school in adopting the broader and bolder technique of Rembrandt's mature style, though he seldom approached the master in humanity or depth of feeling. In surprising contrast to his normal Rembrandtesque style are a number of highly finished genre subjects - guardroom scenes, backgammon players, and so on. An example of the early style, once thought to be by Rembrandt, is the Christ Raising the Daughter of Jairus in the Staatliche Museen, Berlin. A good example of genre in the manner of Terborch is The Music Lesson of 1655, in the Statens Museum for Kunst, Copenhagen. The National Gallery in London has a fine group portrait of Four Officers of the Amsterdam Coopers' and Wine-Rackers' Guild dated 1657. "
33873,Agostino Carracci,1557,1602,"Carracci. Family of Bolognese painters, the brothers Agostino (1557-1602) and Annibale (1560-1609) and their cousin Lodovico (1555-1619), who were prominent figures at the end of the 16th century in the movement against the prevailing Mannerist artificiality of Italian painting. They worked together early in their careers, and it is not easy to distinguish their shares in, for example, the cycle of frescos in the Palazzo Fava in Bologna (c.1583-84). In the early 1580s they opened a private teaching academy, which soon became a center for progressive art. It was originally called the Accademia dei Desiderosi ('Desiderosi' meaning 'desirous of fame and learning'), but later changed its name to Academia degli Incamminati (Academy of the Progressives). In their teaching they laid special emphasis on drawing from the life (all three were outstanding graphic artists) and clear draughtsmanship became a quality particularly associated with artists of the Bolognese School, notably Domenichino and Reni, two of the leading members of the following generation who trained with the Carracci. They continued working in close relationship until 1595, when Annibale, who was by far the greatest artist of the family, was called to Rome by Cardinal Odoardo Farnese to carry out his masterpiece, the decoration of the Farnese Gallery in the cardinal's family palace. He first decorated a small room called the Camerino with stories of Hercules, and in 1597 undertook the ceiling of the larger gallery, where the theme was The Loves of the Gods, or, as Bellori described it, ""human love governed by Celestial love"". Although the ceiling is rich in the interplay of various illusionistic elements, it retains fundamentally the self-contained and unambiguous character of High Renaissance decoration, drawing inspiration from Michelangelo's Sistine Ceiling and Raphael's frescos in the Vatican Loggie and the Farnesina. The full untrammelled stream of Baroque illusionism was still to come in the work of Cortona and Lanfranco, but Annibale's decoration was one of the foundations of their style. Throughout the 17th and 18th centuries the Farnese Ceiling was ranked alongside the Sistine Ceiling and Raphael's frescos in the Vatican Stanze as one of the supreme masterpieces of painting. It was enormously influential, not only as a pattern book of heroic figure design, but also as a model of technical procedure; Annibale made hundreds of drawings for the ceiling, and until the age of Romanticism such elaborate preparatory work became accepted as a fundamental part of composing any ambitious history painting. In this sense, Annibale exercised a more profound influence than his great contemporary Caravaggio, for the latter never worked in fresco, which was still regarded as the greatest test of a painter's ability and the most suitable vehicle for painting in the Grand Manner. Annibale's other works in Rome also had great significance in the history of painting. Pictures such as Domine, Quo Vadis? (National Gallery, London, c.1602) reveal a striking economy in figure composition and a force and precision of gesture that had a profound influence on Poussin and through him on the whole language of gesture in painting. He developed landscape painting along similar lines, and is regarded as the father of ideal landscape, in which he was followed by Domenichino (his favorite pupil), Claude, and Poussin. The Flight into Egypt (Doria Gallery, Rome, c.1604) is Annibale's masterpiece in this genre. In his last years Annibale was overcome by melancholia and gave up painting almost entirely after 1606. When he died he was buried accordingly to his wished near Raphael in the Pantheon. It is a measure of his achievement that artists as great and diverse as Bernini, Poussin and Rubens found so much to admire and praise in his work. Annibale's art also had a less formal side that comes out in his caricatures (he is generally credited with inventing the form) and in his early genre paintings, which are remarkable for their lively observation and free handling (The Butcher's Shop, Christ Church, Oxford). Agostino assisted Annibale in the Farnese Gallery from 1597 to 1600, but he was important mainly as a teacher and engraver. His systematic anatomical studies were engraved after his death and were used for nearly two centuries as teaching aids. He spent the last two years in Parma, where he did his own ""Farnese Ceiling"", decorating a ceiling in the Palazzo del Giardino with mythological scenes for Duke Ranuccio Farnese. It shows a meticulous but somewhat spiritless version of his brother's lively Classicism.

Ludovico left Bologna only for brief periods and directed the Carracci academy by himself after his cousins had gone to Rome. His work is uneven and highly personal. Painterly and expressive considerations always outweigh those of stability and calm Classicism in his work, and at its best there is a passionate and poetic quality indicative of his preference for Tintoretto and Jacopo Bassano. His most fruitful period was 1585-95, but near the end of his career he still produced remarkable paintings of an almost Expressionist force, such as the Christ Crucified above Figures in Limbo (Sta Francesco Romana, Ferrara, 1614). The Caracci fell from grace in the 19th century along with all the other Bolognese painters, who were one of Ruskin's pet hates and whom he considered (1847) had ""no single virtue, no color, no drawing, no character, no history, no thought"". They were saddled with the label ""eclectic"" and thought to be ponderous and lacking in originality. Their full rehabilitation had to wait until the second half of the 20th century (the great Carracci exhibition held in Bologna in 1956 was a notable event), but Annibale has now regained his place as one of the giants of Italian painting. Agostino's illegitimate son Antonio (1589?-1618) was the only offspring of the three Carracci. He had a considerable reputation as an artist in his day, but after his early death was virtually forgotten, and it is only recently that his work has been reconsidered. "

87083,Jean-Jacques Lagrenée,1739,1821,"French painter, known as Jean-Jacques Lagrenée the Younger. He was a history painter and engraver, the pupil of his elder brother Louis-Jean-François Lagrenée. With his brother he stayed in Russia (1760-62), then at the Académie de Rome (1763-68). Later he became artistic director of the Manufacture de Sèvres. "
33170,Philips Wouwerman,1619,1968,"The most celebrated member of a family of Dutch painters from Haarlem, where he worked virtually all his life. He became a member of the painters' guild in 1640 and is said by a contemporary source to have been a pupil of Frans Hals. The only thing he has in common with Hals, however, is his nimble brushwork, for he specialized in landscapes of hilly country with horses - cavalry skirmishes, camps, hunts, travellers halting outside an inn, and so on. In this genre he was immensely prolific and also immensely successful. He had many imitators, including his brother Pieter, and his great popularity continued throughout the 18th century. Subsequently he has perhaps been underrated, for although his work generally follows a successful formula, he maintained a high quality; his draughtsmanship is elegant, his composition sure, his colouring delicate, and his touch lively. "
36688,Walter Richard Sickert,1860,1942,"English painter, printmaker, teacher and writer of German birth. Sickert was one of the most influential British artists of this century. He is often called a painter's painter, appealing primarily to artists working in the figurative tradition; there are few British figurative painters of the 20th century whose development can be adequately discussed without reference to Sickert's subject-matter or innovative techniques. He had a direct influence on the Camden Town Group and the Euston Road School, while his effect on Frank Auerbach, Howard Hodgkin and Francis Bacon was less tangible. Sickert was the son of Oswald Adalbert Sickert, a Danish-born German draftsman who settled in England in 1868. After several years working as an actor, in 1881 the younger Sickert attended the Slade School of Art in London. In 1882 he became an assistant to James McNeill Whistler, and the following year he met the French Impressionist Edgar Degas in Paris; these artists greatly influenced his work. In particular, Sickert was indebted to Degas for the ability to establish a situation merely through the attitudes of his figures. His first pictures of London music-hall interiors, which became one of his most typical subjects, appeared in 1888 at the New English Art Club. Such works helped introduce Impressionism's subject matter of everyday life to the British public. After making a living as a portrait painter throughout the 1890s, from 1898 to 1905 Sickert lived in Dieppe, France, and in Venice, often painting landscapes. In 1905 Sickert returned to London, where he joined the painters Augustus John and Lucien Pissarro, the son of Impressionist master Camille Pissarro, in advocating advanced ideas in British painting. During the latter part of the decade he began to depict disturbing subject matter, such as a series of chilling, ambiguous works entitled Camden Town Murder. By 1911 Sickert became the leader of the Camden Town Group, an association of artists who advocated an unromanticized vision of the urban scene; the rough quality of the group's aesthetic is apparent in paintings by Sickert such as Ennui (c. 1913). The group also organized exhibitions of French and British Impressionism and Post-Impressionism that exposed the British public to important developments in European avant-garde art. From the mid-1920s to the end of his life, Sickert lived in a variety of locales, including Dieppe and, in England, Bath and Kent. In his later work he increasingly used photographs, rather than live models, as the basis for his work. He also occasionally wrote art criticism for the leading journals of the day. Sickert's active career as an artist lasted for nearly 60 years. His output was vast. He may be judged equally as the last of the Victorian painters and as a major precursor of significant international developments in later 20th-century art, especially in his photo-based paintings. "

He exhibited at several different galleries in Brussels and in Ghent. In 1888 Lemmen joined the art group Les XX (Les Vingt). He met Théo van Rysselberghe, which led him to move towards Neo-Impressionism. Inspired by his friendship with Georges Seurat, Lemmen began experimenting with Divisionism and adopted a Pointillist style. He continued painting in a pointillist way till 1895, four years after the death of Seurat. After 1895, Lemmen abandoned Pointillism to Art Nouveau. He created numerous book illustrations, ceramics, carpets, posters, drawings, pastels and gouaches in this particular style. "

34089,George Cruikshank,1792,1878,"English printmaker and draftsman, an artist famous for his political cartoons and prolific book illustrations. In his later career he made moral narratives in woodcut, especially in regards to the temperance movement. Cruikshank was also an actor. His father, Isaac Cruikshank, was a caricaturist who died as a result of his alcoholism in 1811. After a brief education at an elementary school in Edgeware, Cruikshank set himself up as a caricaturist in London. An early influence on Cruikshank was James Gillray, Britain's leading caricaturist at the time. Cruikshank was soon selling his drawings to over twenty different printsellers. This included a large caricature that appeared in each issue of William Jones's satirical magazine, The Scourge. These early drawings included attacks on the royal family and leading politicians such as Lord Castlereagh and Lord Sidmouth. In 1818 George Cruikshank joined forces with Radical publisher and bookseller, William Hone, who was playing a leading role in the campaign against the Gagging Acts. In their struggle for press freedom, the two men produced The Political House that Jack Built. Hone later recalled he got the idea while reading the House That Jack Built to his four-year-old daughter. The 24 page pamphlet contained political nursery rhymes written by Hone and twelve illustrations by Cruikshank. The Political House That Jack Built was an immediate success selling over 100,000 copies in a few months. The two men followed this success with a series of political pamphlets including The Queen's Matrimonial Ladder (1819) and The Man in the Moon (1820). In August 1821 the two men produced a mock newspaper, A Slap at Slop. Cruikshank did not hold strong political beliefs and was willing to produce anti-radical prints for Tory booksellers like George Humphrey. Cruikshank appears to have lost interest in politics in the 1820s and began to concentrate on theatrical caricatures and book illustrations. In 1836 he met Charles Dickens and the two men worked on several projects together. Cruikshank illustrated Sketches by Boz (1836) and Oliver Twist (1838) and also supplied the drawings for Bentley's Miscellany, a journal edited by Dickens. Like many artists, Cruikshank was unhappy about the changes that had resulted from the Industrial Revolution. He was a strong supporter of the Temperance Society and in 1847 produced The Bottle which sold almost 100,000 copies and The Drunkard's Children (1848). "

41473,Giovanni Balducci,1555,1636,"Italian painter. He was trained by Giovan Battista Naldini, who was influenced by Vasari and late Florentine Mannerism. Between 1575 and 1579 Balducci collaborated with Federico Zuccaro on Vasari's frescoes of the Last Judgement in the dome of Florence Cathedral. He enrolled in the Accademia del Disegno in 1578. In 1577 and 1580 he worked with Naldini on the decoration of the Altoviti Chapel in Trinità dei Monti, Rome. On his return to Florence, he assisted Alessandro Allori in the decoration of the ceilings in the corridor of the Uffizi gallery. His work on the decoration of Florence Cathedral for the wedding of Ferdinand I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany, in 1589, includes the Last Supper. The Mystic Marriage of St Catherine (San Gimignano, Sant'Agostino) dates from the same year. From 1588 to 1590, for Cardinal Alessandro de' Medici, he painted one of his finest works, a cycle of scenes from the Life of Christ (Florence, Oratory of the Pretoni). While there are echoes of 15th-century classicism in the treatment of faces and in certain motifs, the painting has the simple devotional quality typical of Florentine art of this period, which was dominated by the influence of Santi di Tito. In 1590-91, again with Naldini, Balducci worked on the decoration of Volterra Cathedral, for example the Miracle of the Loaves and Fishes in the Serguidi Chapel. The Nativity (Volterra, San Francesco) is dated 1592. The artist was brought to Rome by Cardinal Alessandro in 1594, where he painted a cycle of frescoes for the church of San Giovanni Decollato.  That same year, the artist was commissioned by the cardinal, alongside Agostino Ciampelli and Girolamo Massei, to create a decorative cycle for the church of Santa Prassede with scenes from the Passion. Balducci worked in Rome until Alessandro de' Medici's departure in 1596 to become legate to France where his cousin, Maria de' Medici, was queen. The artist then moved to Naples where he would remain until his death. "

41920,"Jan van de Velde, II",1588,1641,"Dutch printmaker, born probably in Delft. He was son of Jan van de Velde I, the famous Antwerp calligrapher who had moved to the northern Netherlands in 1592 to escape religious persecution. Jan van de Velde II was the pupil of Jacob Matham in Haarlem. he was admitted to the Guild of St. Luke in 1614. In 1636 he settled in Enkhuizen, where he died in 1641. Jan van de Velde II was one of the group of Dutch artists working in Haarlem during the second decade of the 1600s, who created the distinctive Dutch seventeenth-century landscape. He shows his skill as a printmaker by densely hatching his shadows without allowing the surface of the copper plate to break up in the acid bath. The result resembles a photographic negative, so that etched lines represent blackness, and the scraps of unmarked paper, gleaming like glow-worms in the night, define fields, foliage, clouds and the moon. "
40798,Orazio Samacchini,1532,1577,"Italian painter (also Sammacchini or Sammachini). Although a pupil of Pellegrino Tibaldi, his early work mainly reflects the classicism of Raphael as interpreted by Bagnacavallo and the Mannerism of Innocenzo da Imola and Prospero Fontana. Simplicity of form, limpid colours and purity of line characterize such early works as the Marriage of the Virgin (c. 1555-60; Bologna, S Giuseppe). Also datable to this early period is the Mystic Marriage of St Catherine (Bologna, private collection), which unites the style and typological elements of Fontana with a highly refined use of colour reminiscent of early 16th-century south Netherlandish painting. In 1563 Samacchini participated in the decoration of the Belvedere and the Sala Regia in the Vatican. This Roman experience resulted in works characterized by complicated compositional solutions and spaces teeming with lively, clearly articulated figures. The influence of Michelangelo can be seen in the Crucifixion (1568; Bologna, S Maria dei Servi) and in frescoes depicting the Brazen Serpent and Moses Striking the Rock (1570-77) in Parma Cathedral. The influence of Federico Zuccaro appears in the fresco of Paolo Vitelli Driving the Venetian Army from the Casentino (c. 1574) in the Palazzo Vitelli a Sant'Egidio, Citta di Castello, while the Presentation in the Temple (1575; Bologna, S Giacomo Maggiore) reflects the late work of Vasari. Certain features of the school of Parma, however, can be traced as early as 1569, for example in the Transfiguration (Bologna, Corpus Domini), which shows the influence of Parmigianino, and in the later frescoes of Virtues, Prophets and Angels in S Abbondio, Cremona, which include suggestions of Correggio. A more discreet Mannerism characterizes his last altarpiece, which depicts the Virgin and Child with Saints (1576-77; Bologna, S Maria Maggiore). "

34965,Josef Hoffmann,1870,1956,"Austrian architect, designer and draughtsman. He had a natural gift for creating beautiful forms, and he proceeded to make the most of it during a career that spanned more than 50 years. In this half-century, the conditions and nature of architectural practice changed profoundly, but Hoffmann’s fundamental approach remained the same. He relied on his intuition to produce works that were unmistakably his own in their formal and compositional treatment, yet mirrored all stylistic changes in the European architectural scene. After attending the State School of Applied Arts in Brno, Hoffmann studied architecture at the Vienna Academy under Otto Wagner. In 1897, he was one of the founders of the Vienna Secession, which he subsequently left in 1905 as part of the Klimt group. As a member of the Wiener Werkstätte, which he founded in 1903 with Koloman Moser, Friedrich Waerndorfer (1868-1939), and Carl Otto Czeschka (1878-1960), and which he headed until 1931, his commissions included a new building for the Westend Sanatorium in Purkersdorf (1904-05), and the Palais Stoclet in Brussels (1905-11). In 1912, he founded the Austrian Werkbund and, from 1920, was the head of the Viennese group within the German Werkbund. From 1899 to 1937, he taught at the Vienna School of Arts and Crafts and became senior building surveyor of the City of Vienna in 1920. Hoffmann numbered amongst the leading architects of Jugendstil, and exerted, in particular through the Wiener Werkstätte, a profound stylistic influence upon the applied arts of his day. His oeuvre was determined by the concept of the total work of art, and he was correspondingly active in every sphere of applied art (furniture, metalwork, glass, leatherwork, jewellery, textiles). The principle of the repetition of an identical element, in particular the square, characterized his ornamental style. Individual components are thereby interchangeable innovative development in Jugendstil design. "
35677,Anton Mauve,1838,1888,"Dutch painter. He came from a large family of clergymen in the province of North Holland. At the age of 16 he was apprenticed to the animal painter Pieter Frederik van Os (1808-1892): animals (especially sheep, but also cows and horses) became Mauve's preferred theme. He then trained for a few months with Wouterus Verschuur (1812-1874), who gave him his love of horses, in the style, at least, of Paulus Potter and Philips Wouwerman. Initially Mauve painted primarily horses. In his further development he worked with Paul Gabriël, painting from nature, and they regularly stayed and worked together at Oosterbeek, the 'Dutch Barbizon'. He was a friend of Jozef Israëls and Willem Maris. In 1872 Mauve settled in The Hague where he became a leading member of the Hague School of painters and one of the founders of the Hollandsche Teekenmaatschappij in 1876, as well as playing a leading role in the development of the Pulchri Studio, The Hague's most influential art society at the time. Mauve was married to Vincent van Gogh's cousin Ariëtte (Jet) Sophia Jeannette Carbentus, and he was a major influence on van Gogh, who revered him. Van Gogh spent three weeks at Mauve's studio at the end of 1881 and during that time he made his first experiments in painting under Mauve's tutelage, first in oils and then early the next year in watercolour (previously he had concentrated on drawing). In the last two years of his life Mauve settled in the village of Laren in the region surrounding Hilversum called het Gooi. The group of painters who settled there, including Jozef Israëls and Albert Neuhuys, came to be known collectively as the Larense School and the region around het Gooi was dubbed 'Mauve land' as far afield as the United States.

His paintings illustrating popular proverbs and religious parables, and his satirical portraits, link him with Quentin Massys and Marinus van Reymerswale, and Hemessen ranks with them as one of the founders of Flemish genre painting.

The Kleinmeister also included Beham's younger brother, Barthel Beham (1502-40), and Georg Pencz (c. 1500-50). All three artists, noted for their brilliant work on extremely small copper plates, grew up under the influence of Albrecht Dürer's late classical style. It is likely that they worked in Dürer's studio. In 1525 the trio was banned from Nürnberg for independent religious views, but not for long. Later Beham moved to Frankfurt am Main. His 252 engravings include biblical and mythological subjects, allegories, genre scenes, and ornaments. Of particular charm were the genre scenes, such as a set entitled Peasant Festival (1537). Some of his woodcuts were of very large size, intended as wall decorations. "

41648,Daniel Gran,1694,1757,"Austrian painter, next to Paul Troger one of the most significant painters of Austrian baroque painting during the first half of the 18th century. The son of an imperial court cook, he first studied with the landscape and genre painter Adam Pankraz Ferg (1651-1729) and then with the decorative and history painter Georg Werle (1668-1727). Werle trained Gran to paint frescoes and introduced him to his first employer and patron, Prince Adam Franz von Schwarzenberg (d 1732). Werle himself worked for the Prince between 1715 and 1719 on frescoes at Ohrada Hunting Lodge, near Frauenberg in Bohemia (now Hluboká, Czech Republic), where he was partly influenced by such Venetian painters as Gregorio Lazzarini and Sebastiano Ricci, as well as by Jacob van Schuppen (1670-1751), a director of the Akademie der Bildenden Künste in Vienna, and his mentors of the French Baroque classical movement; all were artists who later influenced Gran. Schwarzenberg lent Gran money to enable him to travel to Italy to perfect his painting skills. From 1719 he studied mainly with Francesco Solimena and Ricci, the leading masters of the Neapolitan and Venetian schools respectively. Their styles had a strong influence on Gran's subsequent work. He also studied painters of the Italian Renaissance and 17th century; those who influenced him most were Annibale Carracci and Agostino Carracci, Domenichino, Guido Reni, Nicolas Poussin, Andrea Sacchi and Carlo Maratti. In Venice he met Davide Antonio Fossati, who became his first pupil and assistant, and the two artists returned to Vienna together before Easter 1723. In the same year he married Anna Maria Barbara Werle, the daughter of his former teacher. He moved to St. Pölten in 1744/45. His works are influenced both by the abundance of colour of the Venetian painter Ricci, and the dark colours and the heavy, measured figures characteristic of the Neapolitan Solimena; tendency of representative severity and diagonally-rhombic forms of composition. His later works are marked by tight and simple forms of composition and colouring, paving the way for classicism in Austria. "

3082,Pietro Bracci,1700,1773,"Italian sculptor in Rome, a pupil of Camillo Rusconi. He attracted the attention of his contemporaries with his tomb of Benedict XIII in Santa Maria sopra Minerva, designed by Carlo Marchioni, and carried out in collaboration with Bartolomeo Pincellotti, who was responsible for the figure of Humility. This work opened the doors of fame and success to Bracci, who in 1742 became a member of the Accademia di San Luca. Two years later he executed the sculptural groups for the tomb of Maria Clementina Sobieski in St Peter's. He reused this composition in the tomb of Cardinal Leopoldo Calcagnini in Sant'Andrea della Fratte in 1746. Bracci produced several representations of Pope Benedict XIII. His angels in San Ignazio are also famous. "

He started his career in Paris, and worked in Rouen and Amsterdam before moving to The Hague in 1611 where he became a member of the Confrerie Pictura. He travelled in France, Spain, Germany, Bohemia, and Russia. Frisius is regarded as one of the first to bring etching to perfection. Abraham Bosse, in his treatise on the art of engraving, observes that the first artist to whom he was indebted for intelligence was Simon Frisius. "

52988,Corneille de Lyon,1495,1575,"Netherlandish-born painter, active mainly at Lyons in France. He was a native of The Hague (in France he is still often known as ""Corneille de La Haye""), but he settled in Lyons in 1534 and in 1540 he became court painter to the Dauphin, later Henry II. Contemporary references to Corneille indicate that he had a considerable reputation as a portrait painter, but only one work survives that is unquestionably from his hand, a portrait of Pierre Aymeric (Louvre, Paris, 1553), authenticated by an inscription in the sitter's handwriting on the back of the picture. Many other works in a similar style go under his name. They are mostly small in scale and sharply naturalistic in manner, with the sitter usually set against a plain green or blue background. "

9460,Girolamo Genga,1471,1551,"Italian painter and architect. Vasari stated that he was first apprenticed to Luca Signorelli, probably when the latter went to Urbino in 1494. From c. 1498 until 1501 he was active in Pietro Perugino's workshop, where he probably met Raphael. He later went to Florence, remaining there for some years, according to Vasari, before going to Siena, though the sequence of his movements between 1501 and c. 1513 is disputed. His career is unlikely to have followed the neat progression implied by Vasari, and it is more reasonable to consider the artist as relatively mobile, moving between different artistic centres. "

42822,Albrecht Adam,1786,1862,"German painter, part of a family of painters. Albrecht Adam had four sons who were artists: Benno Adam (1812-1892), Franz Adam (1815-1886), Eugen Adam (1817-1880), and Julius Adam (1826-1874). Albrecht's brother Heinrich Adam (1787-1862) was also an artist. Richard Benno Adam (1873-1937) was the grandson of Benno Adam. Albrecht Adam trained under Christoph Zwinger (1744-1813) in Nuremberg, and in 1807 he moved to Munich to continue his studies. From 1809 he worked in Milan, following his appointment as court painter to Eugène de Beauharnais, viceroy of Italy, whom he accompanied to Russia in 1812. After returning to Munich in 1815, he executed a series of 83 small battle-pieces in oil on paper, based on sketches made in 1812. His Russian exploits also provided the material for a set of 100 lithographs entitled Voyage pittoresque et militaire de Willenberg en Prusse jusqu'a Moscou (1827-33), produced with the assistance of his sons Franz and Benno, which helped to establish his contemporary reputation. In Munich, Albrecht's patrons included Maximilian I and his successor, Ludwig I of Bavaria, at whose behest Albrecht painted the Battle of Borodino for the Munich Residenz. For the palace in St Petersburg of Maximilian, Duc de Leuchtenberg, he executed 12 large battle-pieces. Other commissions took him to Stuttgart in 1829 and to Mecklenburg in 1838. After 1848 he was employed as a battle painter by Marshal Radetzky and by Emperor Francis Joseph of Austria, of whom he also produced several portraits during his residence in Vienna from 1855 to 1857. In 1859 he followed the army of Napoleon III during the Italian campaign against the Austrians, which he recorded in a series of drawings and sketches. On his return to Munich he painted the Battle of Landshut (1858-59) for Archduke Charles Ludwig and the Battle of Zorndorf (1859-62; Munich, Maximilianum) for King Maximilian II. In his later years, many of his pictures were painted in collaboration with his sons. "

113081,John Nost Sartorius,1759,1828,"English painter, part of a family of painters. The son of Francis Sartorius I, and grandson of John Sartorius I (c. 1700-c. 1780), he referred himself in the Royal Academy catalogues as ""J.N. Sartorius junior"", to distinguish himself from his father and grandfather. He was the parent of Francis Sartorius II (c. 1777-after 1808) and John Francis Sartorius (c. 1775-c. 1830). Like his father (and, to a degree, his own son John Francis Sartorius) he was itinerant, and his paintings are to be find in very many country houses the length and breadth of England. He painted many sporting scenes for clients whom he met at the Newmarket races, and his clientele numbered many of the most famous aristocratic sportsmen of his age: Lords Derby, Foley, Kingston, the breeders and trainers Christopher Wilson and Sir Charles Bunbury, and grandest of all, The Prince of Wales. His paintings are as popular today as they were in his own lifetime. John Nost was probably the most prolific of the Sartorius family, as more of his works seem to have survived. His exhibited works were primarily portraits of horses but also included racing and hunting scenes. Despite the exclusively rural content of his paintings, Sartorius lived for the greater part of his life in Soho, London. He left us with a evocative record of the sporting life of the late Georgian era. John Nost, although more advanced in style than his father and grandfather, was still rather old-fashioned in technique. He work is frequently naive, although there is a certain characteristic free roundness to his horses which are better painted than his human figures. His composition is usually quite pleasing and his hunting scenes are full of interest. It is easy to be over-critical of his work as so much of it has been defaced by bad restoration. "

He was the son of the artist Francesco Nasini (1621-1695) and was responsible for the revival of Baroque painting in Siena at the end of the 17th century. Between 1681 and 1688 he attended the Accademia Fiorentina, Rome, sponsored by that institution's founder, Cosimo III de' Medici, who commissioned from him the Death of St Peter of Alcántara (1682; Montelupo Fiorentino, convent of the Ambrogiana), a work clearly influenced by Ciro Ferri, director of the Accademia and Nasini's teacher. In 1685-86 Nasini was in Siena and painted, assisted by his brother Antonio Nasini (1643-1715), the fresco on the Antiporta di Camollia, which he subsequently restored (1699; destroyed in 1944). A bozzetto survives by Antonio Nasini (Siena, Collection Chigi-Saracini); there is also a drawing (Paris, Louvre) by Giuseppe Nicola Nasini that is probably connected with the work's restoration. In the autumn of 1686, after a brief stay in Bologna, Nasini went to Venice, where he remained until 1688. He drew inspiration from Venetian 16th-century painting and frescoed a chapel in the church of the Umiltà and a lunette depicting St Peter in Prison in the convent of San Giorgio (both destroyed). In Florence, during the reign of Cosimo III de' Medici, Nasini and Giuseppe Tonelli were commissioned to fresco an Allegory of the moral and religious virtues of the Medici for ceiling of the gallery of the Uffizi that overlooks the river Arno. In 1691, he completed frescoes for the Compagnia di San Luca in the church of the Carmine, and two ceilings in the Palazzo Medici-Riccardi depicting Jupiter Subdues the Giants. He also frescoes for the Landi Chapel in the church of the Carmine. He painted a fresco of the Allegory of Reason(1694) for the palazzo Tolomei-Biffi. In 1720, he returned to Rome, where he painted in the church of the Santi Apostoli, the Quirinal Palace, and one of the nave paintings in San Giovanni in Laterano. In Foligno, he painted a San Leonardo for the church of the Madonna del Pianto. For the Chapel of the Madonna inside the church of Santa Maria della Scala of Siena, he painted a series of paintings consisting of large canvases portraying scenes from the life of the Virgin, as well as frescoes depicting the Coronation of the Virgin. Giuseppe's brother, Antonio Nasini (1643-1715), son Apollonio Nasini (1692-1786), and cousin Tommaso Nasini (1663-1691) were also painters. "

50370,Francesco Bonsignori,1460,1519,"Italian painter. His father, Albertus Bonsignori, was reputedly an amateur painter; and besides Francesco, the oldest and most talented of his children, three other sons, including Bernardino (c. 1476-c. 1520) and Girolamo (b. c. 1479), are also recorded as painters. Barely 20 paintings and fewer than a dozen drawings have been attributed to Francesco Bonsignori. Documents from his time at the Gonzaga court in Mantua and Vasari's account of his life are the main sources for information on the artist. In Verona, he was under the influence or a pupil of Liberale da Verona. In 1487, he went to Mantua, where he was largely patronized by the Marchese Francesco Gonzaga and was influenced by Mantegna. He excelled in painting animals. In the Brera at Milan is his St Louis and in the refectory of the church of the Franciscans at Mantua are some perspective views. His last production was The Vision of Christ to the nun Ozanna, dated 1519, and now in the Academy at Mantua. "

1396,Jacques de Baerze,,,"Flemish sculptor. He probably came from Gent, and lived in Dendermonde some thirty kilometres away from Dijon. He was clearly a well-established master before the death in January 1384 of the local ruler, Louis II of Flanders, Duke of Brabant, as two commissions from Louis to produce carved altarpieces are recorded, though the works have not survived. These were for the chapel of the castle of Dendermonde, and the hospice of the Cistercian abbey of Bijloke, then just outside Gent. These works were noticed by Philip the Bold, Duke of Burgundy, Louis's son-in-law and successor as Count of Flanders. In 1385 Philip had founded a Carthusian monastery, the Charterhouse of Champmol, then just outside Dijon, as the dynastic burial-place of the Burgundian Valois, and was filling it with impressive works of art. In 1390, he commissioned de Baerze to create two similar altarpieces for Champmol: one, now known as the Altar of Saints and Martyrs for the chapter house, and the larger, now known as the Retable of the Crucifixion, for the main altar of the church. Both are triptychs with hinged wings, carved on the interior, but the exterior panels, showing when the wings were closed, were to be painted by his court artist Melchior Broederlam. These painted outer panels only survive for the larger of the two retables. The triptychs would normally be shown closed, displaying the paintings, but opened to show the carvings for feast days. The altarpieces were installed in Champmol by the end of 1399, after which de Baerze disappears from documented records. Other smaller carvings attributed to de Baerze survive, including the figure from an altar crucifix which formed part of the Champmol commission, now in the Art Institute of Chicago, and a St George in the Mimara Museum in Zagreb.

36763,Spinello Aretino,1341,1410,"Spinello Aretino (Spinello di Luca Spinelli), Italian painter and draughtsman. He came from Arezzo (hence the name Aretino) and probably trained in Florence, perhaps under Agnolo Gaddi. He was the most prolific muralist of his time and undertook large fresco cycles all over Tuscany. His last series was the cycle devoted to the Sienese pope Alexander III in Siena Town Hall (1408-10). He also painted altarpieces. Spinello borrowed ideas freely from other painters, notably Giotto, but his style was sturdy and vigorous. Several fresco fragments by Spinello are in the National Gallery, London. Spinello's most important commissions were painted in Arezzo, Lucca, Florence, Pisa and Siena. His concern for space and the powerful outlines of his figures reflect a greater understanding of Giottesque principles than that of many of his contemporaries, yet his keen sense of decoration reveals an equal sensitivity to Sienese painting. His influence, alongside that of Antonio Veneziano and Agnolo Gaddi, was fundamental for the course of Florentine painting in the period after the death of the Cione brothers, and it paved the way for such important Late Gothic painters as Lorenzo Monaco and the Master of the Straus Madonna.  His son Parri Spinelli was his assistant. "

36299,Domenico Quaglio,1787,1837,"Italian painter, draughtsman and printmaker. He was part of an Italian family of artists, active in Germany. They originally came from Laino, a small village in Valle d'Intelvi near Como. Their activity in Italy and Germany extended over eight generations; they worked as fresco painters, architects, decorators and painters of vedute and genre scenes. Eight Quaglios were stage designers who dominated the court theatres at Mannheim and Munich for five generations, as the last representatives of a great theatrical tradition that originated in Italy. Domenico was the son of Giuseppe Quaglio. He studied first under his father and then with Johann Michael Mettenleiter (1765-1853) and Carl Ernst Christoph Hess (1755-1828). From 1803 he painted scenery for architectural stage sets at the Hoftheater in Munich and in 1819 he finally turned to drawing and painting architecture and landscapes. In 1823 he founded the Munich Kunstverein, along with Joseph Karl Stieler, Peter von Hess and Friedrich von Gärtner (1791-1847), to create better opportunities for artists to sell and exhibit their works. From the 1820s he travelled through central Europe recording such well-known monuments as the cathedrals of Strasbourg, Cologne and Reims. During these years he also painted numerous views of Munich, e.g. the Old Riding School with the Café Tambosi in the Year 1822 (Munich, Neue Pinakothek), recording the city's appearance before King Ludwig I's architectural changes. As in the views of Canaletto, these scenes, for which he used uniformly warm, earthy colours, are enlivened by a shifting play of light and shade. The figures in them are also interesting from the point of view of costume history. He had a love of Gothic buildings and showed his debt to Romanticism by painting images of medieval hermitages and castles. In 1833 Crown Prince Maximilian II of Bavaria (later Maximilian II) commissioned him to take charge of the restoration of the ruin of Schloss Hohenschwangau, and in 1833 he began the project, with Georg Friedrich Ziebland as his assistant. Quaglio also began the redesigning of the interior; it was finished after his death by Moritz von Schwind. "

His marines and coastal pictures, some of which were accepted at the Paris Salon, were only moderately successful, but he acquired a fair knowledge of contemporary French Realist art and felt that Norwegian artists should learn from it. He admired in particular Jules Bastien-Lepage. Thaulow made a significant and original contribution to Realism and formed an important link between Norwegian and French painting. His work refrained from becoming repetitive because he was constantly travelling and depicting new places. "

The work of the two artists is at times so close that attributions, especially among their drawings, have often been confused. In his designs for sculpture, architecture and decorative ornament, Ferri was indebted to both Cortona and Bernini. Ferri's art was important in spreading the decorative style of the Roman Baroque to Florence and to other cities. "

He went to England in 1708 with Pellegrini, with whom he worked on stage scenery, and in 1710 he seems to have gone back to Venice to fetch his uncle. They returned together to England in 1712, travelling via the Netherlands, and remained for about four years, arriving back in Venice c. 1717. The remainder of his life is ill-documented: he appears to have worked for Sebastiano on landscape backgrounds for large religious works and to have executed small landscapes in tempera on leather. His landscapes are often 'capricci', they are usually lively and free in handling. He was one of the first Venetian etchers of the 18th century, and his 'Experimenta' were published poshumously in 1730. "

He was initially a pupil of Bartolommeo Passerotti, but then became a pupil under Agostino and Lodovico Carracci. He helped paint, along with Lucio Massari and Leonello Spada, stories of Torquato Tasso's epic in the loggias of the Bentivogli palace. He also frescoed a ceiling for the signori Conti Boschetti in Modena and in the Oratorio della SS Trinità in Pieve di Cento. In Bologna, he painted a Coronation of the Madonna del Borgo for the church of San Petronio. He also frescoed in the cloister of San Michele in Bosco. His son Filippo became a pupil of Guido Reni. Another pupil was Domenico Ambrogi. In engraving he was instructed by Agostino Carracci, and he is said to have forwarded some of the plates of that master. He made engravings after Parmigianino, Lodovico, Agostino and Annibale Carracci. "

He studied in Berlin under the French painter Le Sueur, who taught him in the classical Baroque style of Dutch landscape, but when he moved to Rome he became one of the ""Roman Germans"" to turn to Poussin and apply the Neoclassical principles to landscape painting. In 1786 he became court painter to Ferdinand IV of Naples. He was a sensitive upholder of the ideal landscape tradition of Claude, which he seasoned with touches of Romanticism. Much of his prolific output was devoted to views of famous sites, which were eagerly sought by foreign visitors to Italy. He came from a family of artists and often collaborated with his brother Johann Gottlieb Hackert (1744-73). Goethe met Hackert in 1787 and wrote his biography in 1811. "

36558,Bartolomeo Schedoni,1578,1615,"Italian painter whose untimely death (perhaps suicide owing to gambling debts) brought an abrupt end to the career of one of the most attractive painters of the seventeenth century and an eccentric exponent of the Emilian school. He was connected to the Farnese courts in Parma and Modena where he both assimilated and reworked a variety of different influences. Among them we can see both a direct line to Correggio, the finely detailed way of working used by the Carracci cousins, and all of the latest trends from Rome. Ranuccio Farnese sent Schedoni to Rome at the close of the sixteenth century, but he soon returned to Emilia and settled in Parma. It was there that he painted a small but fascinating group of masterpieces in a severe and noble style. At the same time his works were warmed by a light that softened fabrics and added delicacy to expressions. Although the dates and places were different, Schedoni's personal story ran along similar lines to Caravaggio's. His violence and trouble-making got him into endless scrapes with the law, while his passion for tennis was so great that he almost lost the use of his right hand. "

14096,Gustav Klimt,1862,1918,"Austrian painter and graphic artist. He was just 14 when he won a scholarship to the Kunstgewerbeschule in Vienna. Together with his brother Ernst Klimt (1864-1892) and his fellow student Franz Matsch (1861-1942), between 1882 and 1892, he carried out a number of major commissions for wall and ceiling paintings. During this period, he was awarded the Golden Order of Merit and the Imperial prize. In 1897, he was a joint founder of the journal Ver Sacrum and the Vienna Secession, which he left in 1905 with a number of his friends, including Josef Hoffmann and Otto Wagner, in order to found the Wiener Werkstätte. In 1917, he became an honorary member of the Vienna and Munich academies. Klimt ranks amongst the leading representatives of Viennese Jugendstil. While his early paintings still betrayed the influence of Hans Makart, after the death of his brother, he moved away from academic painting and developed his own two-dimensional style, in which representational elements are combined with ornament to achieve a decorative effect. Although his style caused several scandals in his own day (e.g. his ceiling paintings for Vienna University, 1900-03), it also made him a pioneer of modernism. His major works include the Beethoven frieze (1902), Judith (1901), the Kiss (1908) and his wall mosaics for the Palais Stoclet in Brussels (1909-11). As a leading exponent of Art Nouveau, Klimt is considered one of the greatest decorative painters of the 20th century. His depictions of the femme fatale and his drawings treating the theme of female sexuality have assured him a place in the history of erotic art. He is remembered for his role in the formation of the Vienna Secession, the radical group of Austrian artists of which he became the first president in 1897, and also for the frequent scandals and protests that marked his later career.

By 1835 his bust of Andrew Jackson brought him fame and he received many commissions for busts for the rest of his life; he finally went to Italy in 1837 and never returned to the United States. His status as an American Neoclassic sculptor was first established with his Fisher Boy (1841, Metropolitan Museum, New York) and great fame came with the Greek Slave (1844, Raby Castle, Staindrop, and several replicas). This nude girl represents a Greek Christian sold to lustful Turks, and coming at the time of the Greek War of Independence its sentimental eroticism was extremely popular. The statue toured America in 1847 and was a great success at the Crystal Palace Exhibition of 1851. "

34007,Thomas Cole,1801,1848,"American Romantic landscape painter, a founder of the Hudson River School. His family migrated to America from England in 1819 and he became passionately devoted to the natural scenery of his new country. He spent two years at the Academy of Fine Arts in Pennsylvania and made his living as a portrait painter and engraver there and in New York until some of his landscapes attracted the attention of Dunlap, Durand, and Trumbull, in 1825, assuring his success. In the following year he moved to Catskill on the Hudson River, journeying into the mountains, often on foot, to make sketches of the scenery and working his studies up into finished paintings in the studio. He had two stays in Europe, 1829-32 and 1841-42, living mainly in Florence with Greenough. These European visits, during which he came under the influence of Turner and John Martin, turned him increasingly from the depiction of natural scenery towards grandiose historical and allegorical themes, notably the two great series The Course of Empire (New-York Historical Society, 1836) and The Voyage of Life (Munson-Williams-Proctor Institute, Utica, 1840).

20044,Charles Parrocel,1688,1752,"French painter, part of a family of painters, son of Joseph Parrocel. He studied at first with his father and, after the latter's death, with his godfather Charles de La Fosse and with Bon Boullogne. He apparently enlisted in the cavalry c. 1706, but by 1709 he was competing, without success, for the Prix de Rome. In 1712 he moved to Rome where he was a pensionnaire at the Académie de France from 1713 to 1716. He travelled in Italy, visited Malta and settled in Venice for four years. He returned to Paris in 1721 and at once executed two paintings for Louis XV depicting the visit to France of the Turkish ambassador Mehemet Effendi (Versailles, Château); these were later reproduced in the form of tapestries at the Gobelins manufactory. In the same year he was received (reçu) as a member of the Académie Royale, Paris. He executed a number of equestrian portraits, including that of Louis XV (1724; Versailles, Château), but with the faces of the sitters executed by other artists (Jean-Baptiste van Loo in the case of Louis XV). Like his father, however, he was principally a painter of battles and hunts. In 1736-38 he executed for the Petits Appartements at the château of Versailles an Elephant Hunt and a Wild Bull Hunt (Amiens, Musée Picardie). The Musée Carnavalet, Paris, preserves one of his most remarkable drawings, 39 m long, representing the procession celebrating the proclamation in 1739 of the second Peace of Vienna, which marked the end of the War of the Polish Succession. Parrocel took part in the 1737, 1738, 1745 and 1746 Salons, and he rose through the academic hierarchy to become a professor in 1745. During the War of the Austrian Succession he was present at several battles, including Fontenoy (11 May 1745) and Lawfeld (2 July 1747); from his sketches for a series of ten battle pictures intended for the gallery in the château of Choisy, however, he was prevented by ill-health from executing more than two (both Versailles, Château), and even the second was completed by Pierre L'Enfant. Charles was also an engraver and executed 18 plates for François de La Guériniere's École de cavalerie (Paris, 1733), as well as various other military subjects. His style is more realistic than that of his father and his drawing more precise, but his colouring is relatively lifeless; his contemporaries noted that the principal quality of his work was verisimilitude. His pupils included two painters of battle scenes, Philibert-Benoît Delarue (1718-1780) and Pierre L'Enfant (1704-1787). "

28531,Antoine Wiertz,1806,1865,"Belgian painter and sculptor. He was from very humble origins, but his talent for drawing was detected at an early age. He was sent to the Antwerp Academie, where he attended classes given by Willem Herreyns and Mathieu Ignace Van Brée. During a stay in Paris from 1829 to 1832 he came into contact with the Romantic painters, in particular Théodore Géricault, who fostered his admiration for Rubens. In 1832 he won the Belgian Prix de Rome and in 1834 left for Italy where the works of Raphael and, above all, Michelangelo made an overwhelming impression on him. In Rome he abandoned the landscapes and scenes from Roman life, for which he showed a certain talent, and embarked on a much more ambitious work, the Greeks and the Trojans Contesting the Body of Patroclus (1835; Brussels, Musée Wiertz). The painting proved the turning-point in Wiertz's career. Its frenzied composition and violently contorted figures excited considerable interest in Rome. Children fled from it with cries of horror, a fact that delighted the painter. Bertel Thorvaldsen commented, 'This young man is a giant' - a somewhat hasty judgement, constantly repeated by later biographers, which nevertheless determined his subsequent development. In Antwerp and Liège Wiertz was at once acclaimed. He then sent the picture to Paris, expecting final consecration of his genius. However, it was badly hung in the Salon, went unnoticed by the public and was criticized by the press. Wiertz's bitter disappointment was expressed in an undying hatred of Paris, which he never ceased to attack for its dissipation, stupidity and artistic incompetence. In 1839 he settled in Liège with his mother, painting grandiose mythological and historical subjects, which he believed would immortalize him, and portraits to earn a living. The latter, such as the Artist's Mother (1838; Brussels, Musée des Arts Anciennes), were passable, while the former were merely superficial pastiches of Rubens and Michelangelo. However, the new Belgian State was keen to discover 'geniuses of the national art' and admired his weakly Raphaelesque Education of the Virgin (1843, Brussels, Musée Wiertz) and in particular the Revolt of the Rebel Angels (1842; Brussels, Musée Wiertz), a huge picture that Wiertz painted in a few weeks, in an effort to match the panache of Rubens's brushwork. The Belgian government built him a special studio in Brussels (now the Wiertz Museum) to produce these bizarre (and often macabre and erotic) works, and he said they were painted for honour and his portraits for bread.

9285,Lorenzo Garbieri,1580,1654,"Italian painter. He was a follower of Lodovico Carracci, creating a more rigid yet at times powerfully expressionist style in response to the master's emotionalism. His closeness to his teacher can be seen in the early fresco, Lamentation (1600-02; oratory of San Colombano, Bologna), and in the Flagellation that forms part of the Mysteries of the Rosary (San Domenico, Bologna) traditionally attributed to Lodovico himself. Later Garbieri painted the Stoning of St Stephen (Pinacoteca Nazionale, Bologna), the scenes from the Life of Jacob (1606-14; Bologna, Santa Maria della Pietà) and the scenes from the Life of St Carlo Borromeo (1611; San Paolo Maggiore, Bologna), in which Lodovico's classicism is transformed into a stiffer academicism. The harsh, austere style of these works, which include striking nocturnal scenes, movingly evokes the world of the poor; they were perhaps indebted to the painter's contacts with Caravaggio, both through his awareness of Lionello Spada and through direct knowledge of Caravaggio's Incredulity of St Thomas (untraced), which was then in the Lambertini house in Bologna and which Garbieri copied. With his nocturnal scenes of the Deposition and the Entombment (San Antonio Abate, Milan), painted after a visit to Loreto in 1609, he created deeply moving works of true expressive power, which are among the finest Emilian paintings of that period. His style softened in his later years, as in the Healing of the Blind Man (Galeria Pallavicini, Rome). His bright clear light is reminiscent of Giovanni Lanfranco and Sisto Badalocchio's reinterpretation of Correggio's style, as, for example, in the Adoration of the Shepherds (Santo Stefano, Imola), and in the scenes from the Life of the Virgin (1613-14; San Bartolomeo, Modena). But later, in the scenes from the Life of St Felicity (1613-26; San Maurizio, Mantua) and in the Circe (Pinacoteca Nazionale, Bologna), his tense, rhetorical style brings new dramatic power to the stylistic inheritance of Lodovico Carracci.

1573,Paolo Antonio Barbieri,1603,1649,"Italian painter. He was the younger brother of Guercino (Giovanni Francesco Barbieri), and both collaborated with him and worked independently as a still-life painter.  He was a celebrated painter of still-life and animals. He chose for his subjects fruits, flowers, insects and animals, which he painted after nature with a lively tint of colour, great tenderness of pencil, and a strong character of truth and life. He particularly excelled in painting fish, which he represented with astonishing fidelity. Guercino's Libro dei conti, for which, from 1629, Barbieri was responsible, recorded 42 pictures by him, including the Spice Shop. In 1642 Paolo Antonio moved to Bologna with Guercino, and seven more works are recorded in the account book in Bologna. The two brothers collaborated on Flora (1642) and on the Woman and Child with Fruit (both Palazzo Rospigliosi-Pallavicini, Rome); the latter, in which the figures are by Guercino, was bought by Cardinal Mazarin in 1646. They also worked together on Ceres (Palazzo Doria-Pamphili, Rome), in which Paolo Antonio painted the floral decoration. "

41384,Cornelis Bos,1506,1569,"Cornelis Bos (also spelt Bosch, or Sylvius Bus), Flemish printmaker. In 1540 he was registered as a citizen of Antwerp and became a member of the city's Guild of St Luke, although it is possible he was in the city for some time before this date. His first known engraving is Prudence and Justice (1537) after Maarten van Heemskerck. There are several engravings based on Classical statues (e.g. Laokoon, 1548) and the work of Marcantonio Raimondi and Agostino Veneziano, suggesting that Bos may have gone to Rome some time before 1540. It is, however, possible that Bos copied the Italian originals from drawings or prints brought back from Italy by other artists. Between 1540 and 1544 Bos worked in Antwerp as an engraver. Many of his engravings served as illustrations for books, including two treatises on architecture by Vitruvius and Serlio, which were published by Pieter Coecke van Aelst. Bos also provided woodcut designs for a book on anatomy produced by the printer and publisher Antoine de Goys and for a book on Moorish arabesque ornament (Livre de moresques, Paris, 1546), the title-page of the latter playing a crucial role in the development of grotesque scrollwork in Holland. It is generally agreed that this type of ornament was first introduced by Cornelis Floris but that it was Bos who made important contributions to its development, providing a source of inspiration to subsequent generations of craftsmen. Apart from architectural, anatomical and decorative designs, Bos also produced prints of biblical, mythological and allegorical subjects. "

40741,Perino del Vaga,1501,1547,"Italian painter and draughtsman. He trained in Florence, first with Andrea de' Ceri and from the age of 11 with Ridolfo Ghirlandaio. According to Vasari, he practised drawing by copying Michelangelo's cartoon for the Battle of Cascina (destroyed). For Pope Leo X's entry into Florence in November 1515 he painted an allegorical figure on one of the twelve triumphal arches. Soon after, an obscure Florentine painter called Vaga took Perino to Rome, where he became known as del Vaga. There he continued his drawing studies, copying from works of antiquity and Michelangelo's ceiling in the Sistine Chapel. On the recommendation of Giulio Romano and Giovanni Francesco Penni, he joined Raphael's workshop, where he learnt stuccowork and how to design grotesques, through assisting Giovanni da Udine in the Vatican Logge. Soon he was painting scenes from Raphael's designs, and five or six ceiling frescoes in the Logge, including the Story of Joshua and the Story of David, are generally accepted as his. Vasari drew particular attention to scenes under the windows that are painted to look like bronze reliefs (badly damaged). Pictures of this kind became a speciality of Perino's. Before the death of Leo X in 1521, he worked with Giovanni da Udine again, on the ceiling frescoes in the Sala dei Pontefici at the Vatican. On his own he executed the decoration of the hall in Palazzo Baldassini (1520-22) and the Pietà in Chiesa di S. Stefano del Cacco. In 1523 he returned to Florence, running away from plague, where made friendship with Rosso Fiorentino and executed an admirable design of 10,000 Martyrs (lost). A year later he returned to Rome and  frescoed Cappella Pucci in Chiesa della Trinità dei Monti. In 1527 Perino was invited by Andrea Doria to decorate his Palazzo dei Principe in Genoa, where he also executed numerous altarpieces and designs for the tapestries. In 1536 he returned to Rome and received important orders from the papal court: decoration of Sala Paolina and other halls in Castel Sant'Angelo, frescoes in Chiesa di S.Marcello. Vitality and elegance of his style, made Perino del Vaga one of the characters of the Mannerism with a big number of followers in Rome and Genoa. "
34953,George Hitchcock,1850,1913,"American painter, active in the Netherlands. A descendant of Roger Williams (the founder of Rhode Island), he practiced law for several years in New York before deciding in 1879 to become an artist. He studied in Paris with Gustave Boulanger and Jules Lefebvre, in Düsseldorf, and in The Hague with Hendrik Willem Mesdag (1831-1915). He settled in Egmond-aan-Zee, near Alkmaar, in 1883, and was soon widely known for his paintings of religious subjects in contemporary settings and of sunlit views of tulip fields. He returned to the USA only occasionally in later years. Hitchcock's style, similar to Impressionism, has been appreciated more in Europe than in the USA. A good example of his style is the Blessed Mother (1892; Cleveland, OH, Museum of Art). He received some recognition in the USA, such as election to associate membership in the National Academy of Design, New York, and he was the first American to be made a member of the Akademie der Bildenden Künste, Vienna, and the first to become an officer of the Order of Franz Josef. He was also a chevalier of the Légion d'honneur. "

Schinkel was the greatest German architect of the 19th century, but until 1815, when he gained a senior appointment in the Public Works Department of Prussia (from which position he effectively redesigned Berlin), he worked mainly as a painter and stage designer. His paintings are highly Romantic landscapes somewhat in the spirit of Friedrich, although more anecdotal in detail (Gothic Cathedral by a River, Staatliche Museen, Berlin, 1813-14). He continued working as a stage designer until the 1830s, and in this field ranks among the greatest artists of his period. His most famous designs were for Mozart's The Magic Flute (1815), in which he combined the clarity and logic of his architectural style with a feeling of mystery and fantasy. "

40891,Jacob de Wit,1695,1754,"Jacob de Wit was the outstanding Dutch decorative painter of the 18th century, active mainly in his native Amsterdam. He had his principal training in Antwerp and learned much from Rubens's ceiling paintings in the Jesuit Church there (his drawings became valuable records after the paintings were destroyed by fire in 1718). De Wit's style, however, was much lighter than Rubens's, with a Rococo delicacy and charm. He was a Catholic and was the first Dutch artist since the 16th century to carry out a good deal of decorative work for Catholic churches, but he was at his best in domestic ceiling decorations (Bacchus and Ceres in the Clouds, Huis Bosckbeek, Heemstede, 1751). His name has entered the Dutch language to describe a kind of trompe-l'oeil imitation of marble reliefs for which he was renowned; such pictures, usually set over a chimney-piece or door, are called 'witjes ('wit' is Dutch for 'white'). De Wit was also an engraver and a noted collector of Old Master drawings. "

25092,Bernardo Strozzi,1581,1644,"Italian painter, the most important exponent of the rich vein of Genoese art in the seventeenth century. He entered the Capuchin Order in about 1597, hence his nicknames, Il Prete Genovese (the Genoese priest) and Il Cappuccino (the Capuchin). In about 1610 he was allowed to leave his community to look after his sick and widowed mother, and after she died in 1630 he is said to have been pressurized to return, this accounting for his move in 1631 to Venice where he spent the rest of his life). Strozzi was successful and prolific in both Genoa and Venice, painting portraits and allegorical and genre scenes (often of musicians) as well as religious works. The sensuous richness of his style was influenced by Rubens (who worked in Genoa), but his work is highly distinctive, with an air of refinement and tenderness that recalls Van Dyck (who also worked in Genoa). The Ligurian school was molded through its contacts first with Rubens, which led to him using rich, thick colours applied with wide brushstrokes, and later with Van Dyck, whose refined elegance added its own influence. Strozzi's interpretation of these trends was highly original and combined with his thorough knowledge of other currents in art, from the Lombard school to the diffusion of Caravaggio's style. He produced a splendid series of frescos, altarpieces, and paintings for private collectors in Genoa. His paintings were an immediate success in Venice, partly because Palma the Younger had recently died and there was a lack of native painters. From then on, with two other 'foreigners', Fetti and Lys, he kept alive the painterly tradition of the 16th century. Strozzi could be considered one of the most important painters in seventeenth-century Venice. Apart from religious paintings, he was also much admired for the fleshy but lively portraits he painted.

33516,Lazzaro Baldi,1614,1707,"Italian painter. After training in Pistoia with Francesco Leoncini, he moved to Rome to study with Pietro da Cortona. In 1656, under the latter's direction, he contributed to the decoration of the Alexander Gallery in the Palazzo del Quirinale, Rome, where he painted scenes of the Creation of Adam and Eve, the Flood and the Annunciation (all in situ). Shortly after 1658 Cardinal Francesco Paolucci commissioned Baldi to paint frescoes of scenes from the Life of St John the Evangelist in the restored tempietto of San Giovanni in Oleo, Rome, works that were deeply influenced by Pietro da Cortona. Around 1660-65 Baldi frescoed a ceiling in the Palazzo Odescalchi, Rome, with Day, Night, Dawn, Dusk and, in the centre, Apollo in the Chariot of the Sun. This rare mythological decoration was lost in 1745, but the compositions are known from Baldi's surviving drawings (Kunstmuseum, Düsseldorf; Gabinetto Nazionale delle Stampe, Rome) and from engravings made in 1682 by Baldi's pupil Georg Szymonowicz (1660-1711). These commissions ensured Baldi's success, and he was much in demand; he painted mainly religious works, among them altarpieces (e.g. Rest on the Flight into Egypt, c. 1665, church of the Madonna dell'Umiltà, Pistoia) and frescoes for churches in Rome (e.g. the Vision of St John on Patmos, c. 1660-65; San Giovanni Laterano, Rome) and in Tuscany and Umbria.

In 1830, following a difficult childhood, Jacque was apprenticed at the age of seventeen to an engraver of maps and learned the technique of dry point. That same year, he produced his first etching, a copy of a head after Rembrandt. Disappointed by his apprenticeship, he enlisted in the army from 1831 to 1836. During his military service he made some sketches and drawings which he later tried to have published and he is reputed to have submitted two works to the Salon of 1833 in Paris. In 1838, after a two-year stay in London, where he is known to have made some woodcuts illustrating the works of Shakespeare, Jacque returned to France with a solid reputation as a printmaker. He made frequent trips to Burgundy where his parents had settled in 1830; rural landscapes, farm interiors and animals became his favourite subjects. Although well-known as an engraver, from 1845 Jacque turned more and more to painting. It was at about this period that he discovered Barbizon and its surroundings. Enchanted, he settled there in 1849 with his friend Millet. Painting almost exclusively in the environs of Fontainebleau, Jacque made increasing numbers of animal studies at local farms, and became known for his bucolic subjects, such as henhouses, pigsties and flocks of sheep in pasture.

36978,Louis Comfort Tiffany,1848,1933,"American painter and designer, son of the famed jeweller Charles Lewis Tiffany (1812-1902), who was one of the founders of Tiffany and Company. Rather than enter the family silver and jewellery business, the younger Tiffany studied painting with George Inness (1825-1894) and then travelled to Europe and North Africa. Upon his return, he became a decorator before finally setting up his own glass and decorating firm in 1879. He is best remembered for his remarkable work with decorative iridescent glass. He began experimenting with stained glass in 1875 and co-founded a glass-making company in New York City in 1878. When disagreements between Tiffany and his partners caused the business to close in the mid-1880s, Tiffany started his own firm (later named Tiffany Studios). In the early 1890s, he created a type of glass known for its iridescent colouring, called ""Favrile,"" helping him secure his status as a world leader in glass production. Tiffany gained an international reputation through such exhibitions as the World's Colombian Exposition of 1893 in Chicago, for which he designed a Romanesque-style chapel with glass mosaics (reconstructed at Morse Museum of American Art, Winter Park, Florida). His work was admired by the Parisian critic and dealer S. Bing, who exhibited it in his Paris shop L'Art Nouveau. In 1894-05 Bing commissioned Tiffany to make 11 glass windows (Musée d'Orsay, Paris) for the shop, based on designs by such artists as Bonnard, Maurice Denis, and Toulouse-Lautrec. Tiffany also designed several houses and apartments for himself and his family, including a studio (late 1880s) in New York with a chimney-piece that anticipated the work of Gaudí. Between 1902 and 1904, he designed his large country residence, Laurelton Hall (destroyed 1957. It was an expression of Tiffany's eclectic interests: it combined various exotic styles in a colourful assemblage and incorporated some of his best windows, such as the Four Seasons (exhibited 1892) and Wisteria (both Morse Museum of American Art, Winter Park, Florida). Other major accomplishments of the early 20th century include a glass curtain (1911; in situ) for the Palacio de Bellas Artes of Mexico City and the Dream Garden (1915; in situ), a large-scale mosaic after a design by Maxfield Parrish for the Curtis Publishing Co. Building in Philadelphia. "

40757,Mattia Preti,1613,1699,"Mattia Preti (also called Il Cavaliere Calabrese) was an Italian Baroque painter. He came from Taverna in Calabria (hence his nickname) and his prolific career took him to many different parts of Italy (and according to an early biographer to Spain and Flanders). Mattia Preti left Calabria to join his brother Gregorio, also a painter, in Rome. He met with such outstanding success that within a short time he had become one of the most authoritative southern painters of the second half of the seventeenth century. His early work includes groups of musicians and card-players, strongly Caravaggesque in style, but later he excelled mainly in frescos on religious subjects. In this field his main model was Lanfranco, whom he succeeded in the decoration of S. Andrea della Valle in Rome (1650-51). In 1653 he moved to Modena where he painted the frescos in the apse and dome of S. Biagio. The time he spent in northern Italy broadened his artistic culture further. He reached his fullest maturity and originality during the brief but very important period he spent in Naples (1656-60). The plague of 1656 carried off virtually a whole generation of artists in Naples. Preti worked with great success there, gaining many important commissions. They included a series of seven frescos commemorating the plague for the city gates; they no longer survive, but two modelli for them are in the Museo di Capodimonte in Naples and give some idea of how powerful the huge frescos must have been. During this period he turned out several of his masterpieces at a breathtaking rate. Some of them still remain in Naples (Capodimonte, Palazzo Reale), but others have gone abroad, in particular to the United States. In 1661 he went to Malta where he stayed until his death. He alternated between painting altarpieces and frescos for the island's churches, including the cathedral of Valletta. From time to time he paid visits to his home town which, over the years, became almost a gallery of his work. "
23279,Martin Schongauer,1445,1491,"German engraver and painter, active in Colmar, Alsace. In his day he was probably the most famous artist in Germany; it was in his workshop that the young Dürer hoped to study, but when he arrived in Colmar in 1492 the master had recently died. Only one painting certainly by Schongauer survives - Madonna in the Rose Garden (St Martin's, Colmar, 1473) - and he is remembered chiefly as an engraver, the greatest of his period. His work was strongly influenced by Netherlandish art, above all by Rogier van der Weyden, but Schongauer had a powerful imagination of his own. He concentrated on religious subjects and about 115 plates by him are known. In them he brought a new richness and maturity to engraving, expanding the range of tones and textures, so that an art that had previously been the domain of the goldsmith took on a more painterly quality. The gracefulness of his work became legendary, giving rise to the nicknames 'Hübsch (charming) Martin' and 'Schön (beautiful) Martin'. "
41845,Gabriel Metsu,1629,1667,"Dutch painter, active in his native Leiden, then in Amsterdam, where he had moved by 1657. Houbraken says he trained with Dou, but Metsu's early works are very different from his - typically historical and mythological scenes, broadly rather than minutely painted. Metsu also painted portraits and still-lifes, but his most characteristic works are genre scenes, some of which rank among the finest of their period. He concentrated on scenes of genteel middle-class life, fairly close to de Hooch and Terborch in style, but with a personal stamp. One of his best-known works, The Sick Child (Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam), is often compared with Vermeer. His work is rarely dated, so his development and relationships with other artists are difficult to trace. "

During this time he familiarised himself with the Baroque and the School of Fontainebleau's Mannerism, new imports into Paris at this time. Among his probably co-students was Simon Vouet. He stayed in Rome from c.1645 to 1653 and worked with artists in Nicolas Poussin's circle, as well as visiting the studios of Andrea Sacchi and Pietro da Cortona. He was highly praised by Gianlorenzo Bernini, who he also visited. Blanchet produced paintings for Niccolò Guido di Bagno (1584-1663), made engravings of ancient tombs and views or prospettive and a mausoleum for René de Voyer d'Argenson, French ambassador to Venice in San Giobbe, Venice (1654).

During his career he engraved over 1500 prints and invented, almost single-handed, the genre of British political caricature. In his lifetime he was feared and admired; his reputation waned in the strait-laced moral climate that succeeded the Regency. He began his career as an engraver of letter-heads and although he later studied at the Royal Academy Schools, he seems to have been largely self-trained. After the publication of his print A New Way to Pay the National Debt (1786), a satire on the royal family, he found his bent in caricature and achieved enormous popularity. He enlarged the scope of Hogarth's satire, making his caricature more personal than Hogarth's general social comment, and he showed great fecundity and vividness of imagination.  In 1831 the Athenaeum described him as a 'caterpillar on the green leaf of Reputation'. His career was cut short by insanity in 1811. "

Lodewijk is best known as a landscape painter, although he also executed landscape engravings and drawings. He was granted a privilege to make tapestry cartoons by the Brussels city magistrate in 1644. In this capacity he worked mainly for weavers such as Jean Courdijn and Baudouin van Beveren. The latter referred to him as the best landscape painter in the country and in 1644 paid him 1000 florins for a series of designs of the Story of Diana and Pan. "

40491,Daniel Nikolaus Chodowiecki,1726,1801,"Polish/German painter and engraver, son of a Polish grain merchant and a French Huguenot emigrant. He spent his entire adult life in Berlin, where he learnt first to become merchant, then studied art in Bernhard Rode's workshop. He became a member and finally in 1797 director of the Academy of Art in Berlin. He achieved his first popular success with the sentimental painting The Parting of Jean Calas From His Family (1767; Staatliche Museen, Berlin), which shows the influence of Greuze. He began engraving in 1758, and he is best known as an engraver. After engraving several subjects from the story of the Seven Years' War, Chodowiecki produced the famous History of the Life of Jesus Christ. Many books were published in Prussia with plates or vignettes by Chodowiecki. His book illustrations include designs for Schiller's Räuber, Cervantes's Don Quixote, Goldsmith's Vicar of Wakefield, and Shakespeare's works. His portrait engravings were based mainly on paintings by his friend, the popular German painter, Anton Graff and Chodowiecki's own sketches from the nature. His 2,000 etchings were a record of 18th-century life in comfortable interiors, observed with a kindly humour that lacked the bite of William Hogarth, with whom he was often compared despite his own disclaimers. Despite working and living in Prussia, speaking German and French, and being married to a French, during whole lifetime Chodowiecki was thinking of himself as a Pole. "

57495,Erhard Schön,1486,1542,"German woodcut designer and painter. He was the son of Marx Schön III, a minor Nuremberg painter, with whom he probably began his training. Then he studied Albrecht Dürer's prints while living in the artist's house for several years. Scholars have attributed some 1,200 illustrations for 116 books and about 200 separate woodcuts to Erhard Schön, making him one of the era's most prolific woodblock designers. His works enjoyed tremendous popularity. Between 1513 and c. 1524 the majority of his woodcuts illustrated religious books. In 1515 he and Hans Springinklee, a collaborator of Dürer, made high quality woodcuts for the Hortulus animae, the most popular pre-reformation anthology of prayers. When Schön adopted Lutheranism in the mid-1520s, he began designing woodcuts for anti-Catholic books and broadsheets. From the mid-1530s Schön's interests changed. He depicted classical themes, which may have been conceived for a print series. In 1538 he published a book on figural design, movement, and correct spatial placement. He also made several paintings, signed drawings, and designed a fountain. "

9769,Bartolomeo di Giovanni,,,"Florentine painter known also as Alunno di Domenico (Pupil of Domenico). This name was invented by Bernard Berenson for the Florentine painter to whom he ascribed most of the designs for Florentine woodcut book-illustrations of the late 15th century. This wholesale attribution has not won general acceptance, but the actual pupil and assistant of Domenico Ghirlandaio postulated by Berenson has been identified as Bartolomeo di Giovanni, who was commissioned to paint the predella of Ghirlandaio's Adoration of the Magi in the Spedale degli Innocenti (Foundling Hospital) in Florence, in 1488. He was most important and talented artist in Ghirlandaio's workshop, who had made an individual and pleasing impression in the fresco of the Sistine Chapel. He has an intense, almost biting Nordic style, and he anticipates the rapid and nervous manner of Piero di Cosimo. He also worked under Botticelli's guidance."

His work closely follows the late works of Reni; through whom he received much prestige. His paintings can be found in the local churches: the Presentation at the Temple in the Oratorio dei Preti, the Virgin in the Church of San Giorgio, the Crucifixion in the church of San Benedetto, the Last Supper in the Church of San Girolamo della Certosa. After the death of Guido Reni, Giovanni Andrea Sirani founded his own school where his daughter, Elisabetta, was his main pupil. His late works have a Venetian influence, which can be compared to such contemporaries as Francesco Gessi and Simone Cantarini. "

33691,Richard Parkes Bonington,1801,1828,"English painter, active mainly in France, where his family moved when he was 15. In 1819 he went to Paris, where he became a pupil of Gros and formed a friendship with  Delacroix. He was influenced by the medievalism and orientalism of the French Romantics and produced paintings in their manner. However, he established his reputation as a landscapist, particularly with his works exhibited at the Salon of 1822 and the so-called 'English' Salon of 1824, at which his own paintings (which won him a gold medal) and those of Constable were the star attractions. In 1825 he accompanied Delacroix to England and sought out pictures by Constable, whose influence is apparent in his subsequent work, and in 1826 he visited Italy, producing some of his finest work in Venice. Bonington was overloaded with work and his delicate health suffered; he died of consumption in London a month before his 26th birthday. Although his career was so brief, Bonington was highly influential, the freshness and spontaneity of his fluid style in both oil and watercolours attracting many imitators. Delacroix wrote of him: 'Other artists were perhaps more powerful or more accurate than Bonington, but no one in the modern school, perhaps no earlier artist, possessed the lightness of execution, which makes his works, in a certain sense, diamonds, by which the eye is enticed and charmed independently of the subject or of imitative appeal.' These qualities are particularly apparent in the 'pochades' (oil sketches done rapidly on the spot as records of transitory effects in nature), a fashion which he together with Turner and Constable was instrumental in establishing. The best collection of Bonington's work is in the Wallace Collection, London, and he is also well represented in the City Museum and Art Gallery at Nottingham, his home town. "

He worked for some years for the Elector of Bavaria and then came to London in 1730, where he painted several decorative cycles (e.g. Rickmansworth, near London, Moor Park Golf Club) and portraits; though these, according to Vertue, were 'not his inclination - nor Talent'. In 1739 he returned to Venice with a small fortune, and it was he who persuaded Canaletto to visit London (1746). In 1747 he went to Madrid as Court painter: Vertue records that news of his death there reached London just as his finest works - in St James's Square - were destroyed. The altarpiece of Emmanuel Collection, Cambridge, is his; other works are in Darmstadt, London, Madrid, Venice and York. "

41238,Jan de Bray,1622,1697,"Dutch painter, the son of the painter Salomon de Bray and his wife Anna Westerbaen, who were married on 13 May 1625. Jan, who was born in about 1627, was probably their eldest son. His younger brothers, Dirck and Joseph, were also active as artists. Jan most likely received his training in the studio of his father Salomon. His earliest drawing dates from 1648 and his first known painting from 1651. He may well have had a hand in some of his father's early commissions during his period as an apprentice. In the 1650s, Jan de Bray emerged as an outstanding portraitist, although he also took an interest in historical subjects. Even before the death of Verspronck in 1662 and the octogenarian Frans Hals in 1666, Jan de Bray became the leading portraitist in Haarlem. In the mid-sixties he received four commissions for life-size collective portraits of governors from the city's charitable institutions. Except for his first efforts in the early fifties, little in his oeuvre recalls the old master, Frans Hals. He often adopted the colourful palette and smooth, limpid manner of van der Helst, qualities evident in his historiated portraits. His contact with Haarlem's classicizing artists, particularly his father Salomon, who was his teacher, made assimilation of these aspects of van der Helst popular style an easy step. The earliest document relating to him is a will he drew up in 1664 naming his brother Dirck as his sole heir. Jan must have gained a considerable reputation in the following years, as he was appointed warden of the Haarlem Guild of St Luke in 1667, and dean in 1671/72,1676, 1681 and 1684/85. He was married in Haarlem in 1668 to Maria van Hees, who died, possibly in childbirth, the following year. In 1671, the widowed Jan de Bray drew up his second will, once again naming his brother Dirck as his sole benefactor. In 1672, Jan married Margaretha de Meyer in Osdorp. He and his wife drew up a will in 1673, but Margaretha died before the year was out. Jan's fourth will dates from the same year. He was married for the third time in 1678, this time to Victoria Stalpert van der Wielen, the daughter of a distinguished Roman Catholic family. In the same year, both Jan and his wife drew up wills - Jan's fifth - shortly before Victoria died in childbirth in 1680. By this time, Jan was also working as an architect: designs for a church for the United Mennonite Congregation in the Peuzelaarsteeg in Haarlem date from 1682; the church itself bears the date 1683 on its facade. In the same year he drew up another will, naming as one of his heirs Johan Lucas de Bray, the son born of his marriage to Victoria Stalpert. It is not known how long this child survived. In 1688, Jan de Bray was said to be living 'Op de lindegraght int Schip de Walvis' in Amsterdam. That year, he presented a detailed proposal to the burgomasters of Amsterdam concerning the construction of a freshwater reservoir near the Amstel river. De Bray may thus be seen as the originator of our present-day water towers. On 21 April 1689, a petition was submitted to the Supreme Court: Jan de Bray had evidently incurred debts through 'misfortune and loss' which he was not in a position to pay. He applied for a dispossession order and was subsequently declared bankrupt. In 1692, Jan de Bray became a burgher of the city of Amsterdam, where he remained until his death in 1697. He was buried in Haarlem, however, on 4 April of that year. Certain circumstances of his life, such as his marriages to Catholic women, suggest that De Bray was probably a Catholic as well. "

He studied by making copies after the work of Guido Reni and Anthony van Dyck, and at the age of 12 he accompanied his father to Marseille, where he worked as his assistant. He probably also assisted Gregorio in the restoration of Andrea Ansaldo's dome in SS Annunziata, Genoa. Lorenzo's early work was influenced by the graceful, elongated figures, spiraling movement and elaborate quadratura of his father. He also responded to the more academic and balanced style of Genoese artists who had worked in Rome with Carlo Maratti and Giovanni Battista Gaulli (Baciccio), such as Paolo Girolamo Piola, and Domenico Parodi. In his ceiling decoration he often used formulae established by the Casa Piola, such as pairs of ignudi and corner ornament. In the 1720s and 1730s he painted numerous frescoes in the churches and palaces in Genoa. Never married, Lorenzo sometimes wore clerical garb and was nicknamed l'Abate de' Ferrari. "

After working as a draftsman in an architect's office and as a clerk for the Guardian Insurance Office (1886-92), Beardsley acted on the advice of Edward Burne-Jones and Pierre Puvis de Chavannes and started working as a freelance artist in 1892. Beardsley was largely self-taught but did attend evening classes at the Westminster School of Art for a short time. In 1892 he achieved success with his illustrations for Malory's Morte d'Arthur, and in 1893 designed the first cover for the periodical The Studio. From 1894 he worked for The Yellow Book, a journal for art and literature, where he became the rage with the publication of his illustrations to the English version of Oscar Wilde's Salome, and the appearance of the first issue of the periodical of which he was art editor. After his dismissal in 1895 as a result of the Oscar Wilde scandal, he became art editor of The Savoy. Owing perhaps partly to tuberculosis which carried him off at the age of 25, his work had a morbid suggestion of depravity which made it the most controversial illustration of his day. Some of his work was frankly pornographic. It may be argued that Beardsley was the most significant figure to emerge in English art in the last decade of the 19th century. In his first maturity from 1892 to 1894, he created a modern style that was wholly personal and, as he put it, 'fresh and original'. The content of Beardsley's art was as startling as its style. His ostensible subjects were drawn from Classical literature and history, the Bible, and the social world of his own time; but his pictures express eternal human truths, given a grotesque force by the power of Beardsley's fevered psyche. In his lifetime and immediately after, his work became widely known and admired abroad and formed an influential part of the current of Art Nouveau and international Symbolism. "

His training culminated in the award of the Prix de Rome in 1782; however, his stay in Rome was terminated when he underwent a 'mystical experience' and was sent back to Paris. He was approved (agréé) by the Académie Royale in 1789 on presentation of the Triumph of Aemilius Paulus (New York, Metropolitan Museum of Art). Although his sister Emilie was guillotined, none of the tragic aspects of the Revolution is apparent in his subsequent work. Instead, he concentrated much of his efforts on creating acute observations of daily life. This is especially true of his work after 1816, when he produced engravings of street vendors, horse markets, and dandies. His wittily malicious satires of Directoire types, Incroyables et merveilleuses, engraved in 1797, made his reputation and set the tone for most of his future aquatinted work, for example Costumes (1814-18). An early practitioner of lithography, he excelled in the acute, unexaggerated observation of contemporary manners, e.g. Delpech's Print Shop (c. 1818) and the Cries of Paris (100 plates, after 1816). Today Vernet is recognized more for his witty, satirical engravings than for his paintings. He is also frequently thought of in association with his son Horace, whose painting talents he fostered and who became even more famous than his father. "

He was a practicing architect by 1843, but in that year he also exhibited a landscape painting, to favourable reviews, at the National Academy of Design, in New York. He greatly admired Thomas Cole for his dramatic use of the American landscape, but Cropsey brought to his panoramic vistas a more precise recording of nature. In 1847 Cropsey made his first trip to Europe, settling in Rome among a circle of American and European painters. His eye for detail in recording nature was encouraged by the Nazarenes, and his American sympathy for historical and literary subjects was sharpened by the antiquities of Italy. He also visited England, France, Switzerland in 1847. He went abroad again in 1855, and resided seven years in London, sending his pictures to the Royal Academy and to the International exhibition of 1862. After his return home in 1863, he opened a studio in New York, where he resided until 1885, when he removed to Hastings-on-Hudson. He co-founded, with ten fellow artists, the American Society of Painters in Water Colours in 1866. Cropsey's interest in architecture continued throughout his life and was a strong influence in his painting, most evident in his precise arrangement and outline of forms. But Cropsey was best known for his lavish use of colour and, as a first-generation member from the Hudson River School, painted autumn landscapes that startled viewers with their boldness and brilliance.

36112,Bernard Palissy,1505,1589,"French glass painter and potter. He probably grew up in Gascony. He settled in Saintes in 1539 or 1540, after a decade of travelling all over France and neighbouring regions working as a peintre-vitrier (one who paints, assembles and installs stained-glass windows) and probably also as a surveyor. During the first decade of his time in Saintes he worked as a surveyor, glass painter and possibly as a portrait painter. In connection with the tax for the salt industry, he received a prestigious royal commission to survey and map the salt marshes of the Saintonge between May 1543 and May or June 1544. His real interest, however, was concentrated on the search for the means of making a white tin glaze such as one embellishing a cup that he had admired during his travels. This change in the direction of his artistic interests occurred when he first settled in Saintes, possibly in the house of Antoine de Pons, the King's Lieutenant in the Saintonge, and Palissy's lifelong friend and patron. Palissy's experiments were so practical and wide-ranging that by the time he had developed a viable formula for tin glaze and the proper kiln and kiln equipment to make white glazed pottery, he had also worked out formulae for other glaze colours and, by mingling them, had produced his terres jaspées, ceramic wares with a glaze resembling the jasper, chalcedony and coloured, mottled stone then being introduced into architecture, furniture and goldsmiths' work. A 'vase de phorphire' listed on an inventory in 1556 among the enamelled earthenwares in the Paris hôtel of the Constable of France, Anne, Duc de Montmorency, was no doubt one of Palissy's terres jaspées. In 1565, Catherine de Medicis and her young son, King Charles IX, probably visited Palissy in his workshop during a nearly two-year tour of France. It was then that Catherine is presumed to have commissioned Palissy to design and construct a large garden grotto for her Palace of the Tuileries, which would be built in Paris near the Louvre, on the grounds of a tile works (tuileries) purchased by François I in 1518. Palissy moved his family to Paris in 1565 and established a workshop there, but was unable to complete the grotto installation because the palace project was abandoned in 1572. After religious civil wars between Catholics and Protestants culminated in the Saint Bartholomew's Day Massacre in 1572, Palissy, fearing for his life, left one of his sons, Mathurin, to manage the Parisian workshop and moved the rest of his family to Sedan, where he established a second atelier. There Palissy continued to receive orders for ceramics and devoted much time to exploring and refining his views on natural history. Around 1576 or 1577 Palissy returned to Paris to live. In 1585 king Henri III made the practice of Protestantism punishable by death and imprisoned those who had previously followed that faith. In 1588 Palissy was incarcerated in the Bastille. In 1590 he died there of malnourishment and vermin-borne disease. "

In 1759 he joined Abbé de Sainte-Non and the French painter Jean-Honoré Fragonard in travels through southern Italy and Sicily. Each man influenced the other's style but not the other's choice of subjects. At the Villa d'Este, Tivoli, Robert produced a quantity of red chalk drawings of ancient buildings in ruined parks, animated with small figures. Returning to Paris (1765), Robert became a member of the French Royal Academy in 1766. A gifted decorative artist, he based his paintings on his Italian drawings, and his popularity was enhanced by exhibitions at the Salons from 1767 on. In addition to Italian landscapes, he painted scenes of Ermenonville, Marly-le-Roi, and Versailles, near Paris, and of the south of France, with its ruined Roman monuments. He also directed the design of the English garden at Versailles. Under Louis XVI he became Keeper of the King's Pictures and one of the first curators of the Louvre.  Although imprisoned during the French Revolution, he continued to work. (He owed his life to an accident whereby another person with the same name was guillotined in his stead.)  He collaborated with Fragonard on a commission for the Musée Français in the Louvre during the 1790s, but at the time of his death he was forgotten. "

41490,Gregorio Pagani,1558,1605,"Italian painter, active mainly in Florence. He was the son of the painter Francesco Pagani, then became a pupil of Santi di Tito, then entered the studio of Ludovico Cigoli. A fine colourist, he helped to renew Florentine art during the last years of the 16th century. His earliest surviving works include the frescoes of the Confirmation of the Rule of St Dominic (c. 1580; Florence, S Maria Novella, Chiostro Grande) and the Meeting between SS Dominic and Francis (Florence, Convento dei Cappuccini di Monturghi). In 1592 he painted the Virgin and Saints (St Petersburg, Hermitage), a work that already reveals his interest in Correggio who deeply influenced him. In the same year he painted a Finding of the True Cross (untraced), a daring composition that is preserved in preparatory drawings. A number of works from the 1590s survive and show Pagani's interest in Emilian art; the Crucifixion and Saints (1595; Florence, S Bartolomeo in Pozzo) and the Virgin and Child with SS Michael the Archangel and Benedict (1595; Florence, S Michele Arcangelo Le Ville). At the turn of the century Pagani was increasingly associated with those Florentine artists who wished to develop a new narrative clarity and directness. His pictures (e.g. Pyramus and Thisbe; Florence, Uffizi) show figures carefully posed with varied expressions and gestures. In the early 17th century Pagani became yet more attracted by naturalism, as in the St Lawrence (1600) in the basilica of the Madonna delle Grazie at San Giovanni, Valdarno. Through his friendship with Bartolomeo Carducho he was influenced by Spanish art, as is evident in the Adoration of the Magi (1603; Florence, S Maria del Carmine). His last works are the Descent of the Holy Spirit (1603; Pistoia Cathedral) and Tobias Restoring the Sight of his Father (1604; Florence, Galleria Palatina). Among his pupils were Cristofano Allori and Matteo Rosselli. "

32014,Pierre-Jules Mêne,1810,1879,"French sculptor, the most prolific French animal sculptor of his time. He worked in Paris and was famous for his naturalistic representations of all kind of animals, particularly horses. The son of a metal turner, he received his earliest teaching on sculpture and foundry work from his father, and he opened his own foundry in the 1850s, creating lost-wax castings of his sculptures in bronze. Although mostly self-taught, Mene was encouraged by sculptor René Compaire, and was also influenced by two painters: Edwin Landseer of England with his expressive sentimentality, as well as Carle Vernet of France, in capturing spirit, grace and compositional beauty in sculptural form. Mêne produced a number of animal sculptures, mainly of domestic animals including horses, cows and bulls, sheep and goats which were in vogue during the Second Empire. He was one of a school of French animalieres which also included Rosa Bonheur, Paul-Edouard Delabrierre, Pierre Louis Rouillard, Antoine-Louis Barye, his son-in-law Auguste Cain, and François Pompon. Mêne specialized in small bronze figures. His work was a popular success with the bourgeois class and many editions of each sculpture were made, often to decorate an increasing number of private homes of the period. "

Her family lived in France from 1851 to 1853 and in Germany from 1853 to 1855. When Mary Cassatt's oldest brother, Robbie, died, the family returned to Philadelphia. She studied art at the Pennsylvania Academy in Philadelphia in 1861 to 1865, which was among the few such schools open to female students. In 1866 Mary Cassatt began European travels, finally settling in Paris. She exhibited at the Paris Salon in 1872, 1873, and 1874. Cassatt met Edgar Degas with whom she had a close friendship. In 1877 she joined the Impressionist group and in 1879 she began exhibiting with them at the invitation of Degas. Her work was frequently characterized by depictions of women in ordinary tasks, and especially with children. Though she never married or had children of her own, she enjoyed visits from her American nieces and nephews. She is most famous for works with the subject of mother and child. She is known for superior draughtsmanship in all the media, notably pastel. After 1900 her eyesight began to fail, and by 1914 she was no longer able to paint. "

He proudly described himself as 'the grandson of Ingres' and advocated that artists should 'always be classical'. He quickly formed a group of close friends including Sargent, Degas, Whistler, Alfred Stevens and Giovanni Boldini. As a student he was very poor and to earn a living spent 10 years decorating plates for the potter Joseph-Théodore Deck. In 1885 he visited London with Gérôme to paint a panorama (untraced). This was the start of a lifelong affection for England, where he returned almost every year. Helleu began a series of paintings and colour prints of cathedrals and stained glass windows in 1893, followed by flower studies and landscapes of parks in Versailles. Helleu took up sailing, owning four yachts over his life. Ships, harbour views, life at port in Deauville, and women in their fashionable seaside attire, became subjects for many vivid and spirited works. In 1904, Helleu was awarded the Légion d'honneur and became one of the most celebrated artists of the Edwardian era in both Paris and London. He was an honorary member in important beaux-arts societies, including the International Society of Painters, Sculptors, and Engravers, headed by Auguste Rodin, and the Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts.
 
On his second trip to the United States in 1912, Helleu was commissioned to design the ceiling decoration in New York City's Grand Central Terminal. He is best known today for his numerous portraits of beautiful society women of the Belle Époque. "

Showing a marked aptitude for drawing, he was sent to London to study under Giuseppe Grisoni (1699-1769), who had left Florence for London in 1715. When Grisoni returned to Italy in 1728, Hoare went with him, travelling to Rome and continuing his studies under the direction of Francesco Fernandi. He remained in Rome for nine years, returning to London in 1737. He failed to establish himself there and settled in Bath, an expanding spa town with a constant influx of visitors eager for portraits, whose needs he met by producing pastels influenced by Rosalba Carriera. He was closely involved with the running of the Royal Mineral Water Hospital in Bath from 1742 and became acquainted with its notable visitors and the neighbouring landed families. He obtained numerous commissions for oil portraits, the most important being for official portraits of political men (e.g. William Pitt the Elder, c. 1754; London, National Portrait Gallery); there are several versions of most of these, suggesting that he had a studio, and they were further publicized by the production of mezzotints by leading engravers of the day. Hoare himself was a delicate etcher and published a number of private plates, mostly of family and friends, including Miss Hoare (probably Mary), Henry Somerset, 3rd Duke of Beaufort and Christopher Anstey (all London, British Museum).

36283,Camillo Procaccini,1546,1629,"Italian painter, printmaker and draughtsman, son of Ercole Procaccini I. He was first mentioned in 1571 as a student in the Bolognese painters' guild when his father, Ercole I, was its head. This, and the stylistic maturity of his earliest surviving documented works, the frescoes in San Prospero, Reggio Emilia, suggest his date of birth. Trained by his father, he went to Rome c. 1580 with Conte Pirro Visconti, an important Milanese collector. His studies in Rome, particularly of the art of Taddeo Zuccaro, clearly affected his work after his return to Bologna. In 1582 he decorated the side walls of the apse of San Clemente, Collegio di Spagna, Bologna, and these frescoes (partially photographed before their destruction in 1914) seem to have been an energetic reflection of the exaggerated forms and contrasts of scale typical of mid-16th-century central Italian painting. In 1587 he participated in the fresco decoration of the Basilica della Ghiara in Reggio Emilia. In the late 1580s he moved to Milan, where count Camillo Visconti Borromeo commissioned him the decoration of his villa in Lainate. The organ shutters for the Cathedral of Milan were painted after 1590 by Camillo, Giuseppe Meda (died 1599), and Ambrogio Figino. His other works of note include the frescoes of the nave and the apse of the Cathedral of Piacenza in collaboration with Ludovico Carracci, and the vault and choir in Santi Paolo e Barnaba of Milan. Also famous is a Nativity in the Sacro Monte d'Orta. Among his pupils is Carlo Biffi. "

27538,Alessandro Vittoria,1525,1608,"Italian sculptor and architect, son of a tailor in Trent. After apprenticing to sculptors in his hometown, in 1543 Vittoria moved to Venice, where he lived, with only two interruptions, for the rest of his life. There he entered the workshop of Jacopo Sansovino and continued to work for Sansovino during the 1540s. By 1550 he was an independent master. His earliest known sculpture, the marble statuette of St John the Baptist (San Zaccaria, Venice, right-hand stoop), dates from 1543. Following a quarrel with Sansovino, Vittoria began working outside Venice, in the cities of Trent and Vicenza (1551-53). His main project in Vicenza was the stucco decoration of rooms in Andrea Palladio's Palazzo Thiene (now Banca Popolare), where the ceilings chart the development of his decorative idiom. As a result of Pietro Aretino's mediation Vittoria was reconciled with Sansovino, and by May of 1553 he was back in Venice. The two large caryatids known as the Feminone (1553–55), at the entrance to the Libreria Sansoviniana, were Vittoria's first essay in large-scale stone sculpture. As Sansovino's closest collaborator during the 1550s, he worked on a number of projects in Venice that were headed by Sansovino, including the stuccos (1556; 1559–60) over the monumental staircase of the Libreria Sansoviniana and those (1557–9) over the Scala d'Oro in the Doge's Palace. These sumptuous decorations further extend the principles applied in the Palazzo Thiene: the vaults over the staircases are treated as sculpture, with the result that the frescoes are overwhelmed by the massive stuccos surrounding them. The 1560s marked the start of the period during which Vittoria reached full artistic maturity. In November 1561 he was commissioned to work on the altar in the Montefeltro Chapel, San Francesco della Vigna, Venice. Carved of Rovigo stone, the statues of St Anthony Abbot, St Sebastian and St Roch (completed by 1564) show him in full command as a sculptor of life-size figures. Other projects of this decade include - among others - the two marble caryatids, eventually placed on Vittoria's tomb in San Zaccaria, Venice; a marble bust of Priamo da Lezze, placed on the family monument in Santa Maria Assunta dei Gesuiti, Venice, in the 1580s; and a marble bust of Niccolò Massa (Venice, Ateneo Veneto) for San Domenico di Castello, Venice. Vittoria's most ambitious undertaking of the 1560s, however, was the altar of the Zane Family in Santa Maria Gloriosa dei Frari, Venice. The altar was dismantled in the mid-18th century by the monks of the Frari, and only the architectural frame of the altar, two angels on top of the pediment, two of the stucco figures and the centrepiece of the work, a marble, over life-size St Jerome, survive. During 1574 Vittoria worked on the four great stucco Evangelists set into the inner façade of San Giorgio Maggiore, Venice, which was designed by Palladio. These statues formed the earliest component of the decoration of the church, and their spiralling, ecstatic rhythms show the increased expressiveness and poetic quality of Vittoria's figural language at this time. During the 1570s he supervised the decoration of the Chapel of Our Lady of the Rosary in Santi Giovanni e Paolo, Venice. It was during the 1570s that Vittoria brought his portrait style close to perfection. The busts of Tommaso Rangone (Vittoria's only bronze bust), Ottaviano Grimani and Sebastiano Venier were produced in this period. In 1576 Vittoria was at work on the altar for the Scuola di San Fantin (now the Ateneo Veneto), Venice, the major element of which was the marble St Jerome (now Santi Giovanni e Paolo, Venice). This later St Jerome reveals an increasing pathos in Vittoria's work, as well as a change in his sculptural technique to a less detailed, more astringent manner. From the early 1580s onwards Vittoria left more and more tasks to his workshop. Nonetheless Vittoria produced some of his greatest works during the 1580s. Probably in the first half of the decade, he supplied bronzes of the Virgin and St John of a Crucifixion in Santi Giovanni e Paolo, Venice. The terracotta bust of Doge Nicolò da Ponte (Pinacoteca Manfrediniana, Venice), perhaps Vittoria's greatest portrait, was made around 1584. However, after 1585, the autograph production of portrait busts declined sharply. The so-called Pala Fugger (early 1580s; Art Institute, Chicago), a bronze relief of the Annunciation made for Johann Fugger, a member of the famous German banking family, was inspired by Titian's painting of the same subject. Vittoria's bronze statuettes, although an important aspect of his output, have never been thoroughly studied, with the result that basic problems of attribution and chronology persist. They include some of his most beautiful works and demonstrate how medium affects aesthetic: unlike the marble statues, which tend to command only one main viewpoint and which always reflect the shape of the original block of stone, the bronzes are more overtly three-dimensional. Characteristic examples are St John the Baptist (San Francesco della Vigna, Venice) and St Sebastian (Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York). Although the altar Vittoria designed for the Scuola dei Luganegheri (the guild of sausage-makers) in San Salvador is usually dated to 1600, it more likely dates from c. 1590. The figure of St Sebastian in the altar, writhing in pain against the column behind him, is one of the most moving in all Venetian sculpture. Vittoria is known for medals, and he was also an architect and painter, but little is known of his work in these media. From 1602 to 1605 Vittoria oversaw the work on his tomb monument in San Zaccaria, Venice, which was largely carried out by his nephews Vigilio Rubini and Andrea dell'Aquila, to whom he bequeathed his drawings, models and tools. He died at Venice on 27 May 1608. "

40413,Alessandro Allori,1535,1607,"Alessandro Allori (1535-1607), Florentine painter, the pupil and adopted son of Bronzino. An early visit to Rome added the influence of late Michelangelo paintings to that of his master's courtly Mannerism. The Pearl Fishers (Studiolo of Francesco I, Palazzo Vecchio, Florence, c.1570) is generally considered his masterpiece; playful and full of artifice, it combines nude figures obviously drawn from Michelangelo with Bronzino's svelteness and enamelled colouring. He was one of the last notable exponents of Mannerism, painting in a style that had become outmoded by the time of his death. His son Cristofano (1577-1621) was one of the leading Florentine painters of his period, working in a style that was more naturalistic and Baroque than that of his father. He is remembered primarily for one work, Judith with the Head of Holofernes (c. 1615, Pitti, Florence, and other versions), in which his femme fatale mistress is portrayed as Judith and he has depicted his own features in Holofernes' severed head. In the 18th and 19th centuries it was one of the most famous paintings in Italy. The Ashmolean Museum in Oxford possesses portraits by both Alessandro and Cristofano Allori. "

20654,Domenico Piola,1627,1703,"Italian painter, draughtsman, printmaker and designer, part of a family of artists. He was taught to paint by his brother, Pellegro Piola (1617-40). He later worked in partnership with his younger brother, Giovanni Andrea Piola (1627-c. 1713); his three sons Paolo Gerolamo Piola, Anton Maria Piola (1654-1715) and Giovanni Battista Piola (d 1725); his two sons-in-law, Gregorio de’ Ferrari and Domenico Parodi; and his brother-in-law Stefano Camogli (fl 1665-90), a specialist in arabesques of flowers and fruit. From the time of Luca Cambiaso, Genoese ceilings had consisted of rich decorative frescoes surrounded by elaborate ornament. From the latter half of the 17th century and into the early 18th century the Casa Piola came to dominate and unify the production of the various elements involved: quadratura, stucco, sculpture and painting. The workshop’s eminence in all these media enabled it to achieve an artistic monopoly that partially accounts for the decorative consistency in Genoa in the last half of the century. Large decorative projects were comprehensively prepared through drawings, progressing from careful studies of details through compositional sketches to full-scale cartoons. In their decorative projects featuring illusionistic effects the Casa Piola also designed the quadratura, which, to judge from drawings, was often as important to them as the central section of the vault. They also regarded sculpture as an integral part of the design and supplied designs for sculptors, among them Filippo Parodi, Antonio Maria Maragliano, Bernardo Schiaffino and Francesco Maria Schiaffino. Domenico Piola was the leading artist in Genoa in the second half of the 17th century, providing ceiling frescoes for many Genoese churches and palaces and producing paintings for private collectors. He was also a prolific draughtsman, whose many designs for thesis pages and book illustrations promoted his work throughout Europe. The enormous and multifarious productivity of his studio, his numerous collaborations with other artists and the fact that most of his most ambitious projects have been destroyed have discouraged any systematic study of his work.

48865,Claude III Audran,1658,1734,"Painter, part of a French family of artists who trained with his uncles. He was solely a decorative artist, specializing in painted panelling, harpsichord cases and so on; he was, however, able to renew the genre with his arabesques, grotesques and singeries. He became a master in 1692 as 'painter, sculptor, engraver and decorator'. Payments document the variety of his talents: designing tapestries, painting on glass, executing a 'feu d'artifice', and gilding gondolas for the canal at Fontainebleau. In 1704 he was appointed keeper of the Luxembourg, but continued to be much occupied as a general decorator and designer. He worked at Versailles, Anet, Marly, Sceaux, Meudon and La Muette. He also made many tapestry cartoons for the Gobelins, including the Douze mois grotesques (1699) and the Portieres des dieux. Among his very last work was that in 1733 for the Duchesse de Maine at Anet, where he had first been employed some time before 1698. His decorations are now known mainly through his many drawings, a large collection of which is in the Nationalmuseum, Stockholm. His style influenced the decorators of the Régence. Watteau was one of his pupils. Nowadays Claude III is most usually thought of in connection with Watteau, but he is a significant phenomenon in his own right. "
36780,Jan Steen,1626,1679,"Dutch painter. He is best known for his humorous genre scenes, warm hearted and animated works in which he treats life as a vast comedy of manners. In Holland he ranks next to Rembrandt, Vermeer, and Hals in popularity and a 'Jan Steen household' has become an epithet for an untidy house. But Steen, one of the most prolific Dutch artists, has many other faces. He painted portraits, historical, mythological, and religious subjects (he was a Catholic), and the animals, birds, and still-lifes in his pictures rival those by any specialist contemporaries. As a painter of children he was unsurpassed. Steen was born in Leiden and is said to have studied with Adriaen van Ostade in Haarlem and Jan van Goyen (who became his father-in-law) in The Hague. He worked in various towns - Leiden, The Hague, Delft, Warmond, and Haarlem - and in 1672 he opened a tavern in Leiden. His father had been a brewer, and in the popular imagination Steen was a drunken profligate, but there is nothing in the known facts to justify this reputation. Many of his pictures represent taverns and festive gatherings, but they often feature moralizing allusions, and he also painted scenes of impeccable genteelness. Apart from his versatility, richness of characterization, and inventiveness in composition, Steen is remarkable also for his skill as a colourist, his handling of salmon-red, rose, pale yellow, and blue-green being highly distinctive. He had no recorded pupils, but his work was widely imitated."

41717,Pietro Novelli,1603,1647,"Italian painter. Although he only started painting quite late, Novelli went on to become the most important Sicilian painter of the seventeenth century. One of his seminal influences came from studying the works Caravaggio had left on the island, particularly his Adoration of the Shepherds. Novelli also felt the influence of the Genoese school (especially through the paintings at the Oratory of Santo Stefano) and above all Anthony Van Dyck, who had been present in Sicily in 1624. These currents would persist throughout Novelli's career. After working for a while in Palermo, just after 1630 Pietro Novelli set off for Naples and Rome. In Rome he was particularly receptive to Bolognese classicism and neo-Venetian Roman painting, while in Naples he drew on his experience of Caracciolo, Stanzione and Ribera, as well as his contact with the classicising naturalism developed by Andrea Vaccaro. He took on board the example of strong chiaroscuro from Ribera and incorporated it into his own style which became self-assured and very personal. This can be seen from the two canvases about St Benedict in the abbey of S. Martino alle Scale in Mondovi. By now he was the best-known artist in Sicily and certainly the most in demand. He traveled the island incessantly, alternating paintings with plans for fortifications, architecture, jewelry designs, and stage scenery. Among his most important work, we should mention the decoration of the presbytery and apse in the cathedral at Piana degli Albanesi which was commissioned by the Greek community. "

26807,Ugolino di Nerio,,,"Italian painter, also known as Ugolino da Siena. He was probably a pupil of Duccio and perhaps his most faithful follower. He is documented in Siena from 1317 to 1327 and appears to have been an important artist with a successful workshop. None of the documents mentions works of art, however, and it has proved difficult to reconstruct his career. His principal surviving documented work, a polyptych from Santa Croce, Florence, dating from 1325-30, is now dispersed. Ugolino was influenced not just by Giotto, but by other Sienese artists following in Duccio's footsteps, such as Simone Martini and Pietro Lorenzetti. Both of these were linked to the papal court at Avignon, where the Italian style mixed with French Gothic. "

57047,Theodore Roussel,,,"English painter and etcher of French birth. He was born and educated in France and settled in England in 1878, when he quickly established a reputation. Largely self-taught, his few extant early paintings show an eclectic style that combines the techniques of the Old Masters, which he studied in detail, with the subject-matter of modern urban life. In 1885 he was introduced to James McNeill Whistler, his neighbour in Chelsea, London, and in consequence a lifelong friendship was formed. As Roussel was a member of Whistler's London circle his work in watercolour and oil was influenced by the latter in style and choice of subject-matter. His oft-quoted remark that he was a 'pupil of Whistler' is, however, belied by his frequently distinct style, as seen in such paintings as the Reading Girl (1886-67; London, Tate Gallery). In 1888 Whistler introduced him to the techniques of etching and drypoint, resulting in such etchings as the Sign of the 'White Horse', Parson's Green (c. 1893-94). For the remainder of his life he relentlessly pursued the medium, even, like Whistler, designing his own special frames. Always fascinated by the theoretical and practical nature of colour science, he constantly experimented and was an early pioneer of the technique of colour etching in England. An exhibitor with the Royal Society of British Artists under Whistler's presidency, he also frequently exhibited with the New English Art Club and with the International Society of Sculptors, Painters and Gravers, and he was a founder-member of the Allied Artists' Association in 1908. "
31291,Norbert Goeneutte,1854,1894,"French painter and engraver. In 1871, after working briefly as a lawyer's clerk, he entered the studio of Isidore Pils at the École des Beaux-Arts. When Pils died in 1875 Henri Lehmann took over the studio and Goeneutte left, moving to Montmartre. He was a regular customer in the Café de la Nouvelle-Athènes where he met Renoir and Manet, who strongly influenced his style of painting. He often modelled for Renoir (e.g. The Swing, Moulin de la Galette) and Marcellin Desboutin, who inspired his interest in engraving, etching and drypoint. Although Goeneutte was associated with Manet, Degas and Renoir, and his work was influenced by them, for instance in the informality of his compositions, he never exhibited with the Impressionist group, preferring instead the official Salons. Every year from 1876 he exhibited several works in the Paris Salon, such as Boulevard de Clichy under Snow. He visited London in 1880, Rotterdam in 1887 and Venice in 1890. He moved to Auvers for health reasons, and was treated by Dr. Gachet. Through the support of his brother Charles, he was able to continue his artistic career without financial difficulties. Goeneutte was an accomplished engraver, illustrating books, including La Terre by Emile Zola, published in 1899, in addition to a great painter of portraits, landscapes and scenes of both working and upper-class Parisian life.

43454,Francesco Rosselli,1448,1518,"Italian engraver, illuminator, cartographer and painter, part of a family of artists, brother of Cosimo Rosselli. The family was active in Florence during the 15th and 16th centuries. Francesco Rosselli apparently trained as an illuminator; in 1470 he was paid for three historiated initials for a Gradual for Siena Cathedral (Siena, Biblioteca Piccolomini). Stylistically, these are close to the work of Francesco di Antonio del Cherico, who may have been Francesco's master. In 1480 Francesco was in Hungary, possibly working for Matthias Corvinus, King of Hungary and a great patron of books and manuscripts. By 1482 he was apparently back in Florence. He may have fallen under the influence of the Dominican preacher Girolamo Savonarola in the 1490s. He was recorded in Venice in 1505, and again in 1508, when he attended a lecture given by Luca Pacioli on Euclid. Rosselli's cartographic work has not been recognized until relatively recently. He produced the very first map to show the land discovered by Columbus. At the time Rosselli painted his extraordinary world map (measuring just 15 x 28 cm) cartography was still a new and experimental art. "

In 1750, aged 14, he travelled to Würzburg with his father and brother, Giandomenico, where he worked alongside them on the decorative fresco cycle in the Kaisersaal of the Residenz at Würzburg. A number of drawings (Würzburg, Wagner-Museum) has been attributed to him from these apprentice years. In 1753 the family returned to Venice. In 1762 he left Venice for Madrid to accompany his father who worked for Charles III. In Madrid he executed a portrait of the royal family in 1768. He painted a series of pastel portraits which are now in various royal residences in Madrid and in the Prado Museum. After his father's death he received a small pension from the Spanish Court. Lorenzo's gifts were limited, but the work they did together with their father in creating fresco cycles - in Spain and northern Europe as well as Italy - brought the monumental tradition of Italian art to a glorious end.

21157,Pierre Puget,1620,1694,"The greatest French sculptor of the 17th century. He worked mainly in his native Marseille and in Toulon, for although he sought success at court, his work was much too impassioned to fit into the scheme of Le Brun's artistic dictatorship. Morover, he was arrogant and headstrong in temperament and he fell victim to the intrigues of fellow artists. His Baroque style was formed in Italy, where in 1640-43 he worked with Pietro da Cortona in Rome (Palazzo Barberini) and Florence (Palazzo Pitti). Subsequently he made several journeys to Genoa, where he established a condsiderable reputation. His first major work was a pair of atlas figures for the entrance to Toulon Town Hall (1656) and in these he showed the physical vigour and emotional intensity that were the hallmarks of his style. They occur most memorably in his celebrated Milon of Crotona (Louvre, Paris, 1671-82), which was one of his few works accepted for the palace at Versailles. Puget spent his final years embittered by his failures. He worked as a painter, architect, and decorator of ships as well as a sculptor, and was an outstanding draughtsman. As the son and brother of stonemasons, Puget was well equipped to understand the technical aspects of building, though it is not clear how far he was involved in the erection of the few architectural projects that were actually built according to his intentions. Puget's two surviving built works, other than the displaced portal of the Toulon Hôtel-de-Ville, are the Halle aux Poissons, a magnificent temple-like building in Marseille, and the famous Hospice de la Charité, Marseille, for which his designs were accepted in 1671, though the building was not completed until 1747. "
42479,Vincenzo Tamagni,1492,1540,"Italian painter. He was a pupil of Sodoma, whom he assisted on the frescoes in the monastery of Monte Oliveto Maggiore, near Siena. In 1510-12 he executed frescoes of the Virgin and Child with Saints and Others in the ex-pharmacy of the Ospedale di Santa Maria della Croce at Montalcino (Siena) and these show clearly the influence of Sodoma. He then moved to Rome, where he entered the shop of Raphael and probably worked on the decoration of the Loggetta of Cardinal Bernardo Bibbiena in the Vatican; his frescoes of 1516 in the apse of Santa Maria at Arrone (Terni) reflect contemporary Roman ideas, in particular from Raphael's Vatican Stanze and from Baldassare Peruzzi. He then assisted in the decoration of the Vatican Logge, where, on the basis of the frescoes at Arrone, several scenes can be attributed to him, including the Anointing of David, the Adoration of the Magi and the Last Supper. According to Vasari, he also decorated façades (destroyed) of numerous Roman houses. On his return to San Gimignano in 1522, Tamagni executed a Virgin and Child Enthroned for San Gerolamo, and in 1523 the Birth of the Virgin for Sant'Agostino. Also from this period is the Assumption of the Virgin in the Badia at Isola (Siena) and the Virgin and Child with Saints in the parish church of Pomarance, signed and dated 1525. About this date he returned to Rome, where he completed three ceiling frescoes at Villa Lante, of illustrious men and women surrounded by grotesque decoration. After the Sack of Rome in 1527, he returned to San Gimignano, where he executed works including the Mystic Marriage of St Catherine (San Gimignano, Biblioteca Comunale) and the Meeting of Joachim and Anne (San Salvatore, Istia d'Ombrore, Grosseto), signed and dated 1528.

36387,Hyacinthe Rigaud,1659,1743,"French portrait painter, the friend and rival of Largillière. He was born in Perpignan and after working in Montpellier he settled in Paris in 1681. His reputation was established in 1688 with a portrait (now lost) of Monsieur, Louis XIV's brother, and he became the outstanding court painter of the latter part of Louis's reign, retaining his popularity after the king's death. He was less interested in showing individual character than in depicting the rank and condition of the sitter by nobility of attitude and expressiveness of gesture. These qualities are seen most memorably in his celebrated state portrait of Louis XIV (Louvre, Paris, 1701), one of the classic images of royal majesty. Louis so admired this portrait that, although he had intended it as a present to Philip V of Spain, he kept it himself. Rigaud's unofficial portraits are much more informal and show a debt to Rembrandt (The Artist's Mother, Louvre, 1695), several of whose works he owned. The output from Rigaud's studio was vast and examples are in many collections. "

34210,Alexandre Gabriel Decamps,1803,1860,"French painter, draughtsman and printmaker. With his brother Maurice-Alexandre (1804-1852), the art critic and essayist, he spent some years of his youth at Orsay, in Picardy, 'in order to learn to rise early and know the hard life of the fields'. The artwork of the peasants stimulated an interest in drawing. He entered the atelier of Etienne Bouhot (1780-1862) in 1816. Towards the end of 1818 he left Bouhot to study under Alexandre-Denis Abel de Pujol, quitting his studio in 1819-20 in order to embark upon a career as an independent professional artist. Memories of Orsay remained his point of departure throughout his working life, and in this sense he was a self-trained artist. Nevertheless, he admired, and learnt from the art of such diverse artists as Raphael, Titian, Giambologna, Poussin, Rembrandt, Géricault and Léopold Robert. In his youth he travelled in the East, and reproduced Oriental life and scenery with a bold fidelity to nature that made his works the puzzle of conventional critics. His powers, however, soon came to be recognized, and he was ranked along with Delacroix and Vernet as one of the leaders of the French school. At the Paris Exhibition of 1855 he received the grand or council medal. Most of his life was passed in the neighbourhood of Paris. He was passionately fond of animals, especially dogs, and indulged in all kinds of field sports. He died on the 22nd of August 1860 in consequence of being thrown from a vicious horse while hunting at Fontainebleau. His subjects embraced an unusually wide range. He availed himself of his travels in the East in dealing with scenes from Scripture history, which he was probably the first of European painters to represent with their true and natural local background. Perhaps the most impressive of his historical pictures is his Defeat of the Cimbri, representing with wonderful skill the conflict between a horde of barbarians and a disciplined army. Decamps produced a number of genre pictures, chiefly of scenes from French and Algerian domestic life, the most marked feature of which is humour. The same characteristic attaches to most of his numerous animal paintings. He painted dogs, horses, etc., with great fidelity and sympathy; but his favourite subject was monkeys, which he depicted in various studies and sketches with a grotesque humour. Probably the best known of all his works is The Monkey Connoisseurs, a clever satire of the jury of the French Academy of Painting, which had rejected several of his earlier works on account of their divergence from any known standard.

40501,Pietro da Cortona,1596,1669,"Pietro da Corrtona (originally Pietro Berrettini), Italian painter, architect, decorator, and designer, second only to Bernini as the most versatile genius of the full Roman Baroque style. He was named after his birthplace in Tuscany and probably had some training with his father, a stonemason, before being apprenticed as a painter in Florence. In 1612 or 1613 he moved to Rome. His first major works were frescos in Sta Bibiana, Rome (1624-26), commissioned by Urban VIII (Maffeo Barberini), and the patronage of the Barberini family played a major part in his career. For their palace he painted his most famous work, the huge ceiling fresco, Allegory of Divine Providence and Barberini Power. This was begun in 1633, but he interrupted the work in 1637 to go to Florence and paint two of four frescos commissioned by the Grand Duke of Tuscany for the Pitti Palace. He returned to finish the Barberini ceiling in 1639. This, one of the key works in the development of Baroque painting, is a triumph of illusionism, for the centre of the ceiling appears open to the sky and the figures seen from below (di sotto in su) appear to come down into the room as well as soar out of it. It demonstrates Cortona's belief, which came out in a celebrated controversy with Andrea Sacchi in the Accademia di San Luca, that a history painting could be compared with an epic and was entitled to use many figures; Sacchi, intent on classical simplicity and unity, argued for using as few figures as possible. In 1640-47 Pietro was back in Florence to finish his decorations in the Pitti Palace, where he received a new commission for seven ceilings. These Allegories of Virtues and Planets have elaborate stucco accompaniments uniting the painted ceilings with the framework of the rooms, and this form of decoration was widely influential, not only in Italy, but also in France. (Pietro turned down an invitation to visit Paris from Cardinal Mazarin, but his style was taken there by his best pupil, Romanelli.) From 1647 until his death Pietro again worked in Rome, his major paintings from this period being an extensive series of frescos in Sta Maria in Vallicella (the Chiesa Nuova, 1647-65), in which, as in his Pitti decorations, paint and stucco are magnificently combined. He painted many other frescoes in Rome. Throughout his career he also painted easel pictures of religious and mythological subjects. Pietro once wrote that architecture was merely a pastime for him, but he ranks among the greatest architects of his period. His masterpiece is the church of SS. Martina e Luca in Rome (1635-50), which was the first Baroque church designed and built as a complete unity. Although his architecture has all the vigour of his painting, there is less correspondence between the two fields than might be imagined. He never decorated any of his own churches, and indeed they were not designed with fresco decoration in mind. Pietro's great contemporary reputation sank in the next century with that of many other Baroque artists. In a famous passage in his Dizionario delle belle arti (1797), Francesco Milizia wrote: 'Borromini in architecture, Bernini in sculpture, Pietro da Cortona in painting... represent a diseased taste — one that has infected a great number of artists.'

48131,Heinrich Reinhold,1788,1825,"German painter and engraver. His father was the portrait painter Johann Friedrich Reinhold (1744-1807). He studied at the Hochschule der Bildende Künste in Dresden from 1804 to 1807. In 1807 he followed his brother, Friedrich Philipp Reinhold (1779-1840), who was also a painter, to Vienna, where he studied at the Akademie der Bildenden Künste between 1807 and 1809. During the French occupation of the city in 1809, Vivant Denon brought him to Paris to work on a series of engravings about Napoleon. On Napoleon's fall in 1814, he returned to Vienna, where he joined the circle of Ferdinand Olivier and Julius Schnorr von Carolsfeld. He continued to work as a copperplate engraver until 1819. However, with encouragement from his brother Friedrich Philipp, he began to concentrate on landscape painting from 1816. Initially, he painted Vienna and its surroundings; in 1817 he stayed with Ernst Welker (1788-1857) and Johann Christoph Erhard in the Schneeberg area south of Vienna, producing Romantic Landscape with Hunting Scene (1817; Berlin, Neue Nationalgalerie).
