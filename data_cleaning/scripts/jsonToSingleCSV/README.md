# This code converts a folder of .json files into one large .csv file

## simply specify the  json_folder_path  and output_filename

### For example this grabs the exhibition folder : 
```Cython
json_folder_path = '/~path to project folder/550 Project/artic-api-data/json/exhibitions'
```
### This stores the name of the  output filename as exhibition:
```Cython
output_filename = '/~path to project folder /550 Project/artic-api-data/exhibition.csv'
```
